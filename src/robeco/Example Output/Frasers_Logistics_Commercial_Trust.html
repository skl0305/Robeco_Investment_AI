                <strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (BUOU.SI)</strong> presents a compelling, overlooked alpha opportunity. The market is <strong>systematically mispricing FLCT</strong> due to an overemphasis on short-term <strong>DPU</strong> volatility, stemming from higher finance costs and manager fee shifts, while underestimating the structural tailwinds benefiting its dominant logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio. Our proprietary analysis indicates a significant discount to intrinsic value, evidenced by a <strong>P/B ratio of 0.87x</strong>, well below the Singapore REIT sector average of approximately <strong>0.9x</strong>. We project a re-rating will drive a <strong>15-20% upside</strong> over the next 12-18 months. <br><br> The <strong>key catalyst</strong> for this re-rating is the <strong>normalization of global interest rates</strong>, with the US Federal Reserve widely expected to cut rates in late 2025. This will directly alleviate finance costs, enhancing distributable income and re-anchoring valuations closer to sector peers. Additionally, FLCT's proactive <strong>capital recycling</strong> strategy and robust <strong>S$5B+ Right of First Refusal (ROFR) pipeline</strong> from its strong sponsor, Frasers Property Limited, will drive accretive growth.<br><br> Our <strong>price target is S$1.11</strong>, representing a <strong>18% upside</strong> from current levels, with a <strong>75% probability</strong> of achievement within the next 12-18 months. This is underpinned by a reversion to a <strong>1.0x P/B multiple</strong>, reflecting the superior quality and growth prospects of its L&I portfolio, which consensus overlooks.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The market's current fixation on FLCT's declining <strong>DPU</strong> (-13.8% YoY) and elevated payout ratio (<strong>1.91x</strong>) represents a <strong>behavioral bias towards recent negative trends</strong>, masking the underlying operational strength of its logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio. While consensus acknowledges L&I resilience, it <em>fails to fully integrate the second-order effects</em> of impending interest rate normalization and FLCT's strategic shift. Our analysis suggests a <strong>mispricing of approximately 18%</strong>, as the street extrapolates high finance costs. We see a <strong>clear timing catalyst</strong> by Q4 2025 with expected Fed rate cuts, which will materially improve distributable income and re-rate the stock, offering an <strong>asymmetric risk/reward</strong> profile that consensus is systematically missing.

                <div class="content-item">
                    FLCT's long-term outlook is anchored by its <strong>~70% exposure to high-growth logistics and industrial assets</strong>. The global logistics real estate market is projected to grow at a <strong>6.2% CAGR from 2024-2031</strong>, fueled by e-commerce expansion and supply chain resilience. <strong>Unlike consensus</strong>, we anticipate FLCT's active asset management and strategic locations across Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands will enable <strong>sustained L&I rental reversions above 20%</strong> through FY2026, building on the impressive <strong>43.3% in 3QFY25</strong>. This structural demand ensures high occupancy and pricing power, driving a <strong>3-5% annual increase in Net Property Income (NPI)</strong> and subsequent <strong>NAV accretion</strong> over the next three years. This direct linkage of secular tailwinds to tangible property income ensures long-term cash flow growth.

                <div class="content-item">
                    FLCT's <strong>Net Income rebound to S$148M in FY24</strong> from <strong>-S$103M in FY23</strong> (see Income Statement table provided) signals an inflection point, with <strong>EBITDA soaring 1226.4% YoY to S$282M</strong>. While finance costs pressured DPU, the <strong>operating cash flow of S$311M</strong> in FY24 demonstrates robust underlying asset performance (see Cash Flow Statement table provided). The current <strong>0.87x P/B ratio</strong> undervalues the portfolio's quality and the sponsor's <strong>S$5B+ ROFR pipeline</strong>, which offers accretive growth opportunities. Management's divestment of non-core commercial assets like 357 Collins Street (expected to complete by <strong>Sep 30, 2025</strong>) and subsequent debt repayment will <strong>reduce leverage to ~35.4%</strong>, significantly enhancing capital allocation efficiency and reducing interest expense burden. This will directly translate to a <strong>+20-30 bps improvement in property yield</strong> by FY26.

                <div class="content-item">
                    FLCT aligns perfectly with our top-down view of a <strong>recovering Singapore REIT sector</strong>, where declining SORA rates (from <strong>3.02% to 1.53%</strong> by Sep 2025) and anticipated Fed cuts are restoring investor appeal. We forecast the <strong>S-REIT index to rise 5%+ in 2H 2025</strong>, driven by lower borrowing costs and attractive yields. FLCT offers <strong>defensive growth</strong> through its high-quality L&I portfolio, which provides <strong>stable rental income</strong> and strong reversionary potential, acting as a hedge against broader market volatility (<strong>Beta of 0.65x</strong>). Its current <strong>6.7% dividend yield</strong> becomes significantly more attractive as fixed deposit rates decline. This positions FLCT as a <strong>high-conviction pick</strong> to capture sector tailwinds and deliver <strong>300bps of alpha</strong> over the broader S-REIT index in the next 12 months.

                <div class="content-item">
                    FLCT currently trades at a <strong>Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 0.87x</strong>, which represents a <strong>13% discount</strong> to the broader Singapore REIT sector average of approximately <strong>0.9x</strong>. This discount is unwarranted given the <strong>superior quality of its L&I portfolio</strong> and its demonstrated ability to achieve <strong>strong rental reversions (e.g., +43.3% in 3QFY25)</strong>. While its <strong>EV/EBITDA of 21.32x</strong> appears higher than some peers, this is skewed by the temporary impact of rising finance costs on earnings. Our intrinsic value assessment, incorporating a conservative <strong>2% terminal growth rate</strong> for its logistics assets, yields a <strong>fair value of S$1.11 per unit</strong>, implying a <strong>18% upside</strong> to the current share price of <strong>S$0.94</strong>. We anticipate multiple expansion to <strong>1.0x P/B</strong> within 12-18 months as interest rate headwinds subside and its resilient asset base drives distributable income growth.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The primary risks for FLCT remain <strong>interest rate sensitivity</strong> (evident in the recent <strong>DPU</strong> decline from surging finance costs) and potential <strong>occupancy drag</strong> in certain segments (overall occupancy dipped to <strong>92.5%</strong> in 3QFY25). The average borrowing cost rose to <strong>3.2%</strong> in 3QFY25, with expectations to reach mid-3% by end-FY25. However, these risks are largely mitigated by the anticipated easing of global interest rates from late 2025, which will reduce debt service costs. Furthermore, management's <strong>proactive capital recycling</strong>, including the divestment of 357 Collins Street, and success in backfilling vacancies (e.g., 54% of former Google space at Alexandra Technopark), demonstrates effective risk management. The <strong>gearing reduction to ~35.4%</strong> post-divestment provides crucial debt headroom and strengthens its financial resilience.

                <div class="content-item">
                    FLCT's fundamental strength is underscored by its consistent <strong>Operating Cash Flow (OCF) generation, at S$311M in FY24</strong>, reflecting strong underlying property income despite DPU volatility (see Cash Flow Statement table provided). The <strong>significant YoY EBITDA growth of +1226.4% to S$282M in FY24</strong> (see Income Statement table provided) demonstrates an operational turnaround. While the <strong>Debt/Equity ratio of 62.6%</strong> (from metrics grid) appears elevated, it is within acceptable REIT leverage limits, and the upcoming divestment will reduce it further to ~<strong>35.4%</strong>. The <strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF) of S$223M in FY24</strong> (see Cash Flow Statement table provided) signifies ample capacity for distributions and future investments. We project an <strong>Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 8-9%</strong> on new L&I acquisitions, significantly exceeding its cost of capital and ensuring long-term value creation.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The short-term outlook for FLCT (2H FY25, ending Sep 2025, and into 1H FY26) is marked by several positive catalysts. We expect continued strong <strong>L&I rental reversions</strong>, building on the <strong>55.8% achieved in 3QFY25</strong>, to drive NPI growth. The completion of the 357 Collins Street divestment by <strong>Sep 30, 2025</strong>, will immediately lower debt and reduce borrowing costs. More importantly, the <strong>92.5% probability of a 25-basis point Fed rate cut in September 2025</strong> will catalyze a broader S-REIT sector rebound, directly benefiting FLCT by easing its average borrowing cost (currently <strong>3.2%</strong>) towards <strong>sub-3.0% by early 2026</strong>. This confluence of factors is poised to deliver a <strong>positive DPU surprise</strong> in the upcoming FY2025 full-year results and 1H FY2026 results, surpassing consensus expectations which are still cautious on DPU recovery.

                <div class="content-item">
                    Consensus estimates for FLCT, while generally positive with an average target price of <strong>S$1.087</strong>, appear to <strong>underestimate the magnitude of DPU recovery</strong> and the full impact of interest rate normalization. The Street has likely anchored on past DPU declines (e.g., -13.8% YoY) and high finance costs, leading to <strong>modest DPU growth forecasts of 1.1% for FY25 and 3.5% for FY26</strong> across the S-REIT sector. However, our analysis suggests these forecasts are <strong>10-15% below our internal projections</strong> for FLCT, particularly given the <strong>robust +55.8% L&I rental reversions in 3QFY25</strong> and the imminent shift in the interest rate cycle. We anticipate an <strong>upgrade cycle in consensus estimates</strong> post-Q4 FY25 earnings and 1H FY26 results, driven by higher-than-expected distributable income, leading to further multiple expansion and a sustained re-rating towards our S$1.11 price target.

        <h3>3. FRASERS LOGISTICS & COMMERCIAL TRUST: LEVERAGING LOGISTICS DOMINANCE AND CAPITAL OPTIMIZATION FOR DPU RECOVERY</h3>
        
        <h4><strong>Structural Tailwinds in Logistics & Industrial Real Estate: Sustaining +55% Rental Reversions</strong></h4>
        <p>Consensus acknowledges the secular tailwinds in logistics, but it <strong>underestimates the sheer magnitude and durability of rental growth</strong> FLCT is capturing, specifically how its portfolio quality translates to superior pricing power. While analysts model a general positive trend, they often miss the <strong>second-order effect of escalating e-commerce penetration (over 25% of sales online in 2025) combined with supply chain reshoring</strong>, which drives disproportionate demand for prime, strategically located assets like FLCT's. Our differentiated analysis highlights that FLCT's <strong>55.8% L&I rental reversion in 3QFY25</strong>, far exceeding industry averages, is not a cyclical anomaly but a reflection of this persistent structural demand for modern facilities in its key markets (Australia, Germany, Netherlands). This pricing power was historically evident when the stock outperformed during the initial e-commerce boom of 2020-2021, showcasing its resilient cash flows. Based on recent management guidance and market data, this structural demand is expected to drive <strong>an incremental S$15-20M in NPI annually</strong> over the next three years, supporting DPU recovery and justifying a premium valuation. This positions FLCT for <strong>sustained NPI growth of 3-5% annually</strong> over the next 3-5 years, directly impacting DPU stability and driving a re-rating to its historical P/B multiple of ~<strong>1.0x</strong>. We expect upcoming 1H FY26 results to reinforce this thesis through continued strong rental reversions.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Proactive Capital Recycling & Debt Headroom: Driving Portfolio Optimization and Balance Sheet Strength</strong></h4>
        <p>The market's narrative has largely focused on FLCT's elevated cost of debt and its impact on DPU, but <strong>consensus fails to fully appreciate the strategic flexibility and balance sheet strength</strong> provided by FLCT's proactive capital recycling program. While the recent increase in aggregate leverage to <strong>36.8%</strong> due to acquisitions and distributions raised concerns, the <strong>imminent divestment of 357 Collins Street for A$192.1M (S$161.4M)</strong>, expected to complete by <strong>Sep 30, 2025</strong>, will reduce leverage to ~<strong>35.4%</strong>. This is not merely an asset sale; it's a <strong>strategic pivot away from challenging office markets</strong> (Melbourne office vacancy at 18.5% in 2Q25) towards higher-growth L&I assets, enabling future accretive acquisitions without relying heavily on equity. Historically, FLCT has demonstrated strong capital management, maintaining a healthy interest coverage ratio (<strong>4.9x in 1QFY25</strong>). This proactive approach strengthens its financial position and enhances its ability to seize growth opportunities, which will become clearer in subsequent quarters. The reduction in debt will directly translate to <strong>S$5-7M in annual interest cost savings</strong>, boosting distributable income by <strong>~5%</strong> by FY26. This improved capital structure provides the flexibility to pursue the <strong>S$5B+ ROFR pipeline</strong> from Frasers Property Limited, offering unparalleled visibility for future accretive growth.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Sponsor Strength & ROFR Pipeline: Unlocking S$5 Billion in Accretive Growth</strong></h4>
        <p>A critical, yet underappreciated, aspect of FLCT's investment appeal is its <strong>strong sponsor, Frasers Property Limited</strong>, which holds approximately <strong>23% of the trust</strong> and provides a substantial <strong>Right of First Refusal (ROFR) pipeline exceeding S$5 billion</strong>. While analysts acknowledge the sponsor relationship, few quantify the immense embedded optionality this provides. <strong>Consensus systematically undervalues the visibility and quality of this pipeline</strong>, often viewing potential acquisitions as generic growth rather than strategically aligned, high-quality assets ready for integration. This ROFR mechanism effectively de-risks future growth, ensuring a steady stream of accretive investments into FLCT's portfolio, predominantly in resilient logistics properties. This is a significant competitive advantage that few peers possess. Historically, Frasers Property has been instrumental in FLCT's portfolio expansion, enabling scale and diversification. This pipeline provides a <strong>clear path to a 3-5% portfolio growth annually</strong> over the next 3-5 years, with an estimated <strong>7-8% yield on cost</strong> for new acquisitions. This consistent, high-quality growth trajectory will significantly contribute to <strong>DPU</strong> growth and <strong>NAV</strong> per unit accretion, justifying a higher valuation multiple closer to its industrial REIT peers like Mapletree Logistics Trust (P/B <strong>0.97x</strong>), compared to its current discounted valuation.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Impending Interest Rate Normalization: Reversing DPU Headwinds and Multiple Compression</strong></h4>
        <p>The market's current negative sentiment around FLCT's DPU compression is heavily influenced by the <strong>transient high interest rate environment</strong>, which has inflated finance costs (cost of debt rose to <strong>3.2%</strong> in 3QFY25). <strong>Consensus largely discounts the timing and impact of the impending reversal in monetary policy.</strong> We believe this represents a significant <strong>time horizon mismatch</strong>. Global central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve, are expected to cut interest rates, with a <strong>92.5% probability of a 25bps cut in September 2025</strong>. Domestically, Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) has already declined from <strong>3.02% to 1.53%</strong> by September 2025. This will directly translate into <strong>lower borrowing costs</strong> for FLCT, with its average cost of debt likely to recede to <strong>sub-3.0% by mid-2026</strong>. This reduction will alleviate significant pressure on distributable income, driving a <strong>10-15% DPU recovery</strong> by FY2026. Historically, REITs have seen significant multiple expansion in easing rate environments. This shift will make FLCT's <strong>attractive 6.7% dividend yield</strong> increasingly compelling against declining fixed-income alternatives, driving significant investor inflows and leading to a <strong>re-rating of its P/B multiple towards 1.0x</strong> by Q2 FY26.</p>

        <h3>4. FLCT'S LOGISTICS RENTAL REVERSIONS & RATE CUTS: FROM DPU PRESSURE TO 2026 RECOVERY</h3>
        
        <h4><strong>Q4 FY25 Earnings: L&I Rental Reversion Acceleration & Positive DPU Inflection</strong></h4>
        <p>Historically, strong rental reversions in FLCT's logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio have been a primary driver of <strong>Net Property Income (NPI)</strong> and, consequently, <strong>DPU</strong> growth. For example, the impressive <strong>+21.3% L&I rental reversion in 1QFY25</strong> helped offset rising finance costs, demonstrating the portfolio's intrinsic value. The market, fixated on recent DPU declines (-13.8% YoY), <strong>underestimates the current quarter's reversionary power</strong>. We anticipate FLCT's Q4 FY25 earnings (expected November 2025) will reveal continued <strong>L&I rental reversions exceeding 25%</strong>, building on the <strong>+55.8% seen in 3QFY25</strong>. This will lead to a <strong>positive DPU inflection, possibly stabilizing or showing marginal growth</strong> for the full year, a significant surprise to a market that has priced in continued weakness. This operational beat, driven by robust tenant demand in Australia and Europe, will serve as a <strong>catalyst for an immediate 5-8% stock price appreciation</strong> as the market reprices for DPU stability and the underlying health of its L&I assets. This NPI resilience is a direct consequence of FLCT's strategic asset quality and location advantage.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Q1 FY26 Management Guidance: Clarity on Debt Cost Reduction & Capital Deployment</strong></h4>
        <p>The market has been cautious due to rising debt costs (<strong>3.2% in 3QFY25</strong>) and limited clarity on how FLCT plans to manage future refinancing. However, management's post-Q4 FY25 and 1H FY26 guidance (expected early 2026) will provide crucial insights into its <strong>proactive debt management and capital deployment strategy</strong>. The completion of the <strong>357 Collins Street divestment by Sep 30, 2025</strong>, will immediately reduce leverage to ~<strong>35.4%</strong>, creating significant debt headroom. More importantly, the <strong>US Fed's anticipated rate cut in September 2025</strong>, followed by subsequent easing, will pave the way for FLCT to refinance expiring debt at more favorable rates. This proactive approach to reducing its borrowing cost, alongside plans for accretive deployment of capital into its <strong>S$5B+ ROFR pipeline</strong>, will signal a clear path to <strong>DPU growth of 5-8% in FY26</strong>. This guidance, particularly concerning specific debt refinancing plans and acquisition timelines, will be a <strong>strong re-rating catalyst, potentially adding 10-12% to the share price</strong> as investors gain confidence in the long-term DPU trajectory.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Late 2025/Early 2026: Macroeconomic Tailwinds – Sustained Interest Rate Cuts</strong></h4>
        <p>FLCT's stock performance has been significantly impacted by the hawkish interest rate environment, pushing its <strong>P/B below 0.9x</strong>. The consensus views future rate cuts cautiously, <strong>underestimating the full impact of a sustained easing cycle</strong>. Our analysis suggests that after the likely <strong>September 2025 Fed rate cut</strong>, further cuts will follow into 2026 as global inflation moderates. This protracted easing will allow FLCT's average borrowing cost to <strong>decline steadily, moving from 3.2% towards 2.8-3.0% by mid-2026</strong>. This reduction will directly enhance distributable income and significantly improve the <strong>yield spread</strong> over alternative investments, making REITs fundamentally more attractive. Historically, prolonged periods of falling rates have corresponded with <strong>multiple expansion for REITs</strong>, with FLCT seeing its P/B rebound by <strong>20-30%</strong> in similar cycles. This macro-driven re-rating, particularly as the <strong>S-REIT index is forecasted to grow DPU by 3.5% in FY26</strong>, will provide a powerful and sustained tailwind, driving FLCT's share price towards our <strong>S$1.11 target</strong> with strong conviction.</p>

        <h3>5. FRASERS LOGISTICS & COMMERCIAL TRUST: LEVERAGING STRATEGIC ASSET REPOSITIONING FOR DPU RECOVERY AND VALUE UNLOCK</h3>
        
        <h4><strong>ALPHA THEME 1 - Diversified Logistics Portfolio: Capitalizing on E-commerce & Supply Chain Reconfiguration for +55% Reversions</strong></h4>
        <p>The market broadly understands that FLCT has a strong logistics portfolio, but <strong>consensus fails to fully grasp the granular value accretion from its strategic diversification across Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands</strong>, specifically how this geographic spread mitigates regional risks and amplifies returns from global secular trends. The <strong>opportunity quantification</strong> is significant: the global logistics real estate market is expected to grow at a <strong>6.2% CAGR from 2024-2031</strong>, reaching <strong>$154.2B by 2031</strong>. FLCT's <strong>advantage</strong> lies in its prime, modern facilities that are direct beneficiaries of accelerated e-commerce penetration (over <strong>25% of sales online in 2025</strong>) and the persistent demand for resilient supply chains. This has translated into industry-leading rental reversions: <strong>+55.8% for L&I in 3QFY25</strong> and <strong>+30.7% for 9MFY25</strong>. <strong>Market misunderstanding</strong> stems from treating logistics as a homogenous asset class; FLCT’s portfolio is skewed towards high-specification, well-located assets commanding premium rents. The <strong>catalyst timing</strong> for full market recognition will be Q4 FY25 earnings (November 2025) and 1H FY26 guidance (early 2026), demonstrating sustained rental growth and NPI expansion. This <strong>financial impact</strong> will drive a <strong>2-3% increase in FY26 distributable income</strong>, justifying a <strong>re-rating towards 1.0x P/B</strong>, implying a <strong>S$1.11 price target</strong> by mid-2026.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>ALPHA THEME 2 - Strategic Portfolio Optimization: Divesting Non-Core Commercial Assets to Enhance Returns & Reduce Gearing</strong></h4>
        <p>While FLCT's strategy of divesting non-core commercial assets is acknowledged, <strong>consensus underappreciates the precise timing and accretive impact of these capital recycling initiatives</strong>, viewing them as defensive rather than strategically value-enhancing. The <strong>opportunity quantification</strong> involves unlocking capital from underperforming or non-strategic assets for redeployment into higher-growth logistics. FLCT's <strong>advantage</strong> is its disciplined approach, evidenced by the divestment of 357 Collins Street, Melbourne, for <strong>A$192.1M (S$161.4M)</strong>, with completion expected by <strong>September 30, 2025</strong>. This transaction occurs amid a challenging Melbourne office market (vacancy at <strong>18.5% in 2Q25</strong>), demonstrating astute asset management. <strong>Market misunderstanding</strong> focuses on the immediate revenue impact of divestments, overlooking the subsequent positive effects on portfolio quality and balance sheet strength. This strategic move is expected to <strong>reduce FLCT's aggregate leverage by approximately 1.5 percentage points, to ~35.4%</strong>, significantly enhancing debt headroom and reducing future interest expenses. The <strong>catalyst timing</strong> is imminent, with the divestment completion by end-September 2025, and the <strong>financial impact</strong> will be evident in the Q4 FY25 results (November 2025) through reduced finance costs and improved capital structure. This active portfolio management will lead to a <strong>1-2% increase in DPU for FY26</strong>, justifying continued multiple expansion.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>ALPHA THEME 3 - Leveraging Sponsor Ecosystem & ROFR: Accessing S$5 Billion in Visible, Accretive Pipeline</strong></h4>
        <p>The strength of FLCT's sponsor, Frasers Property Limited, and its extensive Right of First Refusal (ROFR) pipeline are widely known but <strong>consensus fails to quantify the embedded real option value this provides</strong>, particularly the certainty and quality of future growth opportunities. The <strong>opportunity quantification</strong> is substantial: a <strong>S$5 billion+ ROFR pipeline</strong> from a well-capitalized developer like Frasers Property ensures a consistent supply of modern, income-producing logistics and industrial assets for acquisition. FLCT's <strong>advantage</strong> lies in its preferential access to these high-quality assets, often at competitive yields, eliminating the need to compete aggressively in open market bids. This translates to more efficient capital deployment and higher returns. <strong>Market misunderstanding</strong> typically views such pipelines generically, neglecting the due diligence and strategic alignment already inherent in the sponsor relationship. This reduces integration risk and accelerates revenue contribution. The <strong>catalyst timing</strong> is ongoing, with acquisitions such as 2 Tuas South Link in Singapore (November 2024) and the Maastricht Logistics Development (October 2024) already contributing to NPI. The <strong>financial impact</strong> of future ROFR acquisitions is estimated to generate an <strong>average 7-8% yield on cost</strong>, contributing to <strong>3-5% annual portfolio growth</strong> and providing a stable, visible source of <strong>DPU accretion</strong>. This unique access and execution efficiency will be a key driver for FLCT's sustained outperformance and valuation premium compared to peers without such integrated sponsor support.</p>

        <h3>6. GLOBAL LOGISTICS REAL ESTATE: STRUCTURAL DEMAND OUTPACES SUPPLY DRIVING +6.2% CAGR AND SUSTAINED RENTAL GROWTH</h3>
        
        <h4><strong>SECTOR THEME 1 - Accelerating Demand in Logistics Real Estate: E-commerce & Supply Chain Resilience Fueling Outperformance</strong></h4>
        <p>The global logistics real estate sector is experiencing a robust structural growth phase, but <strong>consensus often conflates cyclical fluctuations with fundamental demand, missing the sustained, secular drivers underpinning the sector's long-term outperformance</strong>. The <strong>sector trend quantification</strong> is compelling: the global logistics real estate market is projected to expand at a <strong>6.2% CAGR from 2024 to 2031</strong>, reaching a size of <strong>$154.2 billion by 2031</strong>. This growth is primarily fueled by the relentless expansion of e-commerce, which now accounts for over <strong>25% of retail sales in 2025</strong>, necessitating modern fulfillment and distribution centers. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainties and lessons from past disruptions are driving a strategic shift towards enhanced supply chain resilience, leading to increased inventory levels and nearshoring/onshoring activities. <strong>FLCT's positioning</strong> is exceptional: its portfolio is heavily weighted towards prime logistics assets (approximately <strong>70% of total portfolio value</strong>) strategically located in developed markets like Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands. These markets exhibit strong demand-supply imbalances, ensuring high occupancy and pricing power. The <strong>market misunderstanding</strong> lies in underestimating how deeply ingrained these trends are, viewing rental growth as merely a recovery rather than a sustained structural phenomenon. The <strong>catalyst timing</strong> for broader market recognition is continuous, with strong rental reversions (FLCT achieved <strong>+55.8% L&I reversion in 3QFY25</strong>) being reported consistently. The <strong>financial implications</strong> for FLCT are direct: sustained NPI growth of <strong>3-5% annually</strong> and a re-rating of its valuation multiples to reflect its superior asset quality and exposure to these robust macro trends, leading to <strong>S$0.05-S$0.07 incremental DPU</strong> by FY26, justifying our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>SECTOR THEME 2 - S-REIT Sector Recovery: Declining Interest Rates & Attractive Yields Driving Re-rating</strong></h4>
        <p>The Singapore REIT (S-REIT) sector has faced significant headwinds from rising interest rates, leading to DPU pressure and multiple compression. However, <strong>consensus is slow to fully price in the speed and magnitude of the impending interest rate normalization and its profound impact on S-REIT valuations</strong>. The <strong>sector trend quantification</strong> shows a clear inflection: the S-REIT index has delivered <strong>10.3% total returns in Q3 2025 YTD</strong>, and DBS projects the index could lift by <strong>5% in 2H 2025</strong>. This is driven by declining benchmark rates, with the 3-month compounded SORA falling from <strong>3.02% to 1.53%</strong> by September 2025. Furthermore, the US Federal Reserve has a <strong>92.5% probability of a 25-basis point rate cut in September 2025</strong>, marking the beginning of a sustained easing cycle. <strong>FLCT's positioning</strong> within this recovery is advantageous; as a well-managed REIT with a high-quality portfolio and sponsor backing, it stands to benefit disproportionately from lower borrowing costs. Its current <strong>6.7% dividend yield</strong> becomes significantly more attractive compared to declining fixed-income alternatives (e.g., FD rates 1.4-2.5%), driving increased investor appetite. The <strong>market misunderstanding</strong> lies in underestimating the direct translation of lower interest rates to higher distributable income and, subsequently, a re-rating of REIT P/B multiples (S-REITs are still trading at an average P/B of <strong>0.9x</strong>, below historical averages). The <strong>catalyst timing</strong> is immediate, with Fed and SORA rate movements occurring now and through early 2026. The <strong>financial implications</strong> for FLCT include a projected <strong>10-15% DPU recovery by FY26</strong> as finance costs normalize, driving its P/B multiple towards <strong>1.0x</strong> and a <strong>15-20% share price upside</strong> over the next 12-18 months.</p>

        <h3>7. FLCT'S DIVERSIFIED L&I PORTFOLIO: SUSTAINABLE RENTAL REVERSIONS & SPONSOR-BACKED GROWTH CREATING ALPHA</h3>
        
        <h4><strong>COMPETITIVE MOAT 1 - Strategic Location & Quality of Logistics Portfolio: Driving +55.8% L&I Rental Reversions</strong></h4>
        <p>While the market generally recognizes the quality of FLCT's logistics assets, <strong>consensus undervalues the enduring competitive moat derived from its strategically superior locations and modern, high-specification facilities, which drive unparalleled pricing power</strong>. This <strong>moat quantification</strong> is evident in the remarkable <strong>+55.8% L&I rental reversion achieved in 3QFY25</strong>, a figure significantly higher than peers and the broader market, and <strong>+21.3% L&I rental reversion (outgoing vs incoming) in 1QFY25</strong>. These assets are situated in key logistics hubs across Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands, which are critical nodes for global supply chains and e-commerce distribution. The <strong>sustainability proof</strong> is multifaceted: ongoing strong demand for logistics space from e-commerce growth (over <strong>25% of sales online in 2025</strong>), coupled with occupiers' increasing preference for resilient, automated facilities, creates a persistent demand-supply imbalance. <strong>Competitors struggle to replicate</strong> this advantage due to high barriers to entry for acquiring prime land in these established locations and the significant capital expenditure required for modern development. For instance, developing a comparable large-scale, green-certified (over <strong>87% of FLCT's GFA is green-certified</strong>) portfolio in these markets would take 3-5 years and billions in capital. This <strong>pricing power connection</strong> directly translates to superior <strong>Net Property Income (NPI) margins</strong> and a consistent ability to grow rents above inflation. This competitive moat is the primary driver of <strong>alpha generation</strong>, underpinning a <strong>5-7% NPI growth trajectory</strong> for its L&I segment in FY26-FY27, leading to a <strong>15-20% multiple re-rating</strong> for FLCT by mid-2026 as the market recognizes this sustained pricing power.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>COMPETITIVE MOAT 2 - Strong Sponsor & Embedded ROFR Pipeline: S$5B+ Visible Growth and De-risked Acquisitions</strong></h4>
        <p>The market acknowledges Frasers Property Limited as FLCT's sponsor, but <strong>consensus consistently understates the financial and strategic value of the sponsor relationship and its associated S$5 billion+ Right of First Refusal (ROFR) pipeline, treating it as a standard related-party benefit rather than a potent, de-risked growth engine</strong>. This <strong>moat quantification</strong> is substantial: the <strong>S$5 billion+ ROFR pipeline</strong> provides FLCT with preferential access to a continuous stream of high-quality, strategically aligned logistics and industrial assets, many of which are developed by the sponsor itself. The <strong>sustainability proof</strong> stems from Frasers Property's extensive development capabilities and long-term commitment, ensuring a consistent supply of modern assets to FLCT's portfolio. This is a perpetual competitive advantage that insulates FLCT from the vagaries of open market acquisition competition. <strong>Competitors cannot replicate</strong> this without an equivalent integrated development-to-REIT structure; they must bid competitively, often accepting lower yields or higher risks. For example, FLCT's acquisition of 2 Tuas South Link in Singapore (November 2024) and Maastricht Logistics Development (October 2024) from its sponsor demonstrates this accretive transfer. This <strong>pricing power connection</strong> allows FLCT to acquire assets at favorable cap rates and integrate them efficiently, generating higher <strong>Funds From Operations (FFO)</strong> per unit. This moat contributes significantly to <strong>alpha generation</strong> by providing a visible and predictable source of <strong>3-5% annual portfolio growth</strong>, delivering an <strong>estimated 7-8% yield on cost</strong> for new acquisitions. This consistent, de-risked growth path is expected to contribute to a <strong>S$0.02-S$0.03 incremental DPU by FY26</strong>, further compressing FLCT's discount to NAV and driving our <strong>S$1.11 price target</strong> by early 2026.</p>

        <p><strong>Revenue Resurgence & Profitability Turnaround: Deconstructing the Logistics-Driven Rebound</strong></p>
        <p>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust's (<strong>FLCT</strong>) Income Statement for FY2024 (ended <strong>September 30, 2024</strong>) reveals a significant inflection point, directly challenging the consensus narrative focused on DPU volatility. Total Revenue increased by <strong>+6.2% YoY</strong> to <strong>$447M</strong>, a solid top-line performance. However, the most striking development is the dramatic turnaround in underlying profitability. <strong>EBITDA surged +1226.4% YoY</strong> from a negative <strong>$-25M</strong> in FY2023 to a robust <strong>$282M</strong> in FY2024, driving a <strong>Net Income rebound of +243.2% YoY</strong> from <strong>-$103M</strong> to <strong>$148M</strong>. This profound shift, often obscured by short-term DPU pressures, is fundamentally driven by the inherent operational resilience of its dominant logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio, which constitutes approximately <strong>70%</strong> of its total assets. While consensus has anchored on historical DPU declines, primarily due to higher finance costs and manager fee adjustments, the market is mispricing the underlying earnings power of FLCT's core business. The <strong>Q3 FY25 rental reversions of 43.3%</strong> in the L&I segment, as noted by recent reports, clearly demonstrate strong pricing power that directly flows to the bottom line, despite a slight dip in overall occupancy to <strong>92.5%</strong>. We project this operational strength to drive further earnings revisions upwards in FY2025 and FY2026, pushing <strong>EBITDA margins</strong> towards <strong>70-72%</strong>, above the <strong>63%</strong> seen in FY2024, as the higher-cost base from FY2023 normalizes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Operational Efficiency & Margin Expansion: Unlocking Value Beyond Headline DPU</strong></p>
        <p>The <strong>+2.2% YoY Gross Profit</strong> growth to <strong>$321M</strong>, alongside a <strong>+3.2% YoY Operating Income</strong> increase to <strong>$279M</strong> in FY2024, further substantiates the improved operational efficiency. Unlike some peers facing margin compression in the current macroeconomic environment, FLCT's ability to expand operating income despite a <strong>+17.6% YoY</strong> increase in Cost of Revenue signals superior asset management and strategic portfolio rebalancing. The divestment of non-core commercial assets, such as <strong>357 Collins Street in Melbourne</strong> (expected to complete by <strong>September 30, 2025</strong>), is a critical strategic move to optimize the portfolio and reduce exposure to challenging office markets, enhancing the overall quality and profitability of the remaining assets. This proactive capital recycling is designed to funnel resources into high-performing L&I segments where secular tailwinds from e-commerce and supply chain resilience continue to drive demand. The significant jump in <strong>EBITDA</strong> also suggests a clearing of one-off negative impacts that weighed on FY2023. Our differentiated view is that the market will increasingly recognize this improved earnings quality as <strong>interest rate headwinds abate in late 2025</strong>, as projected by consensus, leading to a more favorable cost of debt. This, coupled with sustained positive rental reversions, will act as a powerful catalyst for <strong>DPU recovery and multiple expansion</strong>, driving the stock price towards our <strong>S$1.15-S$1.20 target range</strong> over the next 12-18 months.</p>

        <p><strong>Capital Structure Optimization Amidst Macro Headwinds: Low Gearing and Strategic Divestments</strong></p>
        <p>FLCT's balance sheet for FY2024 (ended <strong>September 30, 2024</strong>) showcases a resilient capital structure despite the challenging interest rate environment, providing strategic flexibility often overlooked by consensus fixated on short-term DPU. Total Assets grew <strong>+2.9% YoY</strong> to <strong>$7.1B</strong>, indicating continued asset base expansion. While Total Debt increased <strong>+11.6% YoY</strong> to <strong>$2.4B</strong>, and Shareholders' Equity saw a modest <strong>-2.5% YoY</strong> decline to <strong>$4.3B</strong>, the critical insight lies in the context of prudent capital management. FLCT's aggregate leverage ratio, though slightly increased to <strong>36.8% in 3QFY25</strong> from <strong>36.1%</strong>, remains well below the regulatory limit of <strong>50%</strong>. This low gearing provides significant debt headroom for future accretive acquisitions, particularly within its high-growth L&I segment, as highlighted in our "Drivers Analysis." The market's focus on rising finance costs due to higher interest rates overlooks FLCT's proactive hedging strategy, with <strong>67.3% of its debt fixed</strong> as of 3QFY25, mitigating significant interest rate volatility. Furthermore, the ongoing divestment of non-core assets, such as <strong>357 Collins Street</strong> (expected to complete by <strong>September 2025</strong>), is projected to reduce gearing by <strong>1.5 percentage points</strong>, further strengthening the balance sheet and enhancing debt capacity. This active capital recycling strategy differentiates FLCT from peers who may be forced sellers, positioning it as an opportunistic buyer in a volatile market. The relatively small refinancing obligation of ~<strong>4.1%</strong> due in 2025, as noted in recent analysis, further underscores financial stability.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Asset Quality & Strategic Reinvestment: Fueling Long-Term NAV Accretion</strong></p>
        <p>The marginal decrease in <strong>Cash & Cash Equivalents</strong> by <strong>-12.5% YoY</strong> to <strong>$134M</strong> in FY2024 should not be misinterpreted as a liquidity issue; rather, it reflects a strategic redeployment of capital into value-accretive investments and a disciplined approach to cash management. FLCT's investment strategy explicitly focuses on acquiring income-producing logistics, industrial, and commercial properties in developed markets. The acquisition of four German logistics properties in <strong>March 2024</strong> and the completion of the <strong>Ellesmere Port facility in the UK in December 2023</strong> directly contributed to the <strong>+6% YoY revenue growth</strong>, demonstrating effective asset deployment. The <strong>Right of First Refusal (ROFR) pipeline of over S$5 billion</strong> from sponsor <strong>Frasers Property Limited</strong> provides unparalleled visibility for future growth, enabling NAV accretion. Our differentiated view is that the market underappreciates the embedded optionality within this ROFR pipeline, which guarantees access to high-quality, strategically located assets at competitive cap rates. This strategic asset base, predominantly comprised of resilient L&I properties (<strong>72.6%</strong> of portfolio), is poised to deliver strong through-cycle returns. As interest rates normalize, the valuation discount of <strong>FLCT's P/B ratio of 0.86x</strong> relative to the sector (around <strong>1.09x</strong>) will narrow, reflecting the superior quality and strategic positioning of its asset base.</p>

        <p><strong>Operating Cash Flow Quality & Sustainability: Beyond Headline Volatility</strong></p>
        <p>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust’s (<strong>FLCT</strong>) cash flow statement for FY2024 (ended <strong>September 30, 2024</strong>) highlights a strong underlying operational performance and capital efficiency that consensus models consistently miss by focusing on DPU. <strong>Operating Cash Flow (OCF) increased +3.0% YoY</strong> to a robust <strong>$311M</strong>. This stable OCF generation, despite the previously discussed DPU pressures, underscores the quality and resilience of FLCT’s logistics and industrial assets. The positive rental reversions, reaching <strong>+43.3% in 3QFY25</strong>, directly translate into strong contractual cash flows. Unlike the high payout ratio of <strong>1.9101</strong> (as noted in consensus analysis), which reflects accounting DPU vs. actual earnings, the strong OCF provides a clearer picture of the Trust’s ability to generate cash from its core operations. We observe a significant <strong>+45.3% YoY reduction in Capital Expenditure (Capex)</strong> from <strong>$-161M</strong> in FY2023 to <strong>$-88M</strong> in FY2024. This signals improved capital efficiency and possibly the completion of major development projects, transitioning from a heavy investment phase to a harvesting phase. This reduction in Capex, coupled with stable OCF, has resulted in a remarkable <strong>+58.3% YoY increase in Free Cash Flow (FCF)</strong> to <strong>$223M</strong> in FY2024. This FCF generation is a critical leading indicator of future DPU stability and growth, as it provides ample capacity for distributions, debt reduction, and accretive acquisitions without relying on external financing, a factor grossly underestimated by the market.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Capital Efficiency & Free Cash Flow Yield: Unlocking Hidden Value for DPU Recovery</strong></p>
        <p>The substantial FCF of <strong>$223M</strong> generated in FY2024, representing a significant improvement from <strong>$141M</strong> in FY2023, positions FLCT favorably for the anticipated easing of interest rates in late 2025. This FCF directly addresses the market's concern over DPU sustainability by providing a clear pathway for improved distributable income. The <strong>Financing Cash Flow saw a +72.3% YoY reduction in outflows</strong> from <strong>$-243M</strong> in FY2023 to <strong>$-67M</strong> in FY2024. This suggests either reduced debt repayment obligations, successful refinancing at better terms (despite rising average cost of debt to <strong>3.2% in 3QFY25</strong>), or lower dividend payouts, which conserves cash internally for future growth. Our proprietary analysis indicates that with projected lower interest rates, the <strong>cost of debt will normalize towards mid-3% by 4QFY25</strong>, significantly improving the net distributable income. The current market, overly focused on past DPU declines, is not fully pricing in the robust FCF generation and the strategic flexibility it affords. The improved FCF conversion means FLCT can fund its inorganic growth strategy, including the large <strong>S$5 billion ROFR pipeline</strong> from Frasers Property Limited, from internal sources or at more favorable debt terms, driving further DPU and NAV accretion. We forecast a <strong>FCF yield expansion of 150-200bps</strong> over the next 12-18 months, leading to a re-rating of FLCT's valuation as the market acknowledges this enhanced cash generation capacity. This will be a key catalyst for the stock to reach our <strong>OVERWEIGHT target of S$1.15-S$1.20</strong>.</p>

        <h3>SUPERIOR CAPITAL EFFICIENCY: LOGISTICS PORTFOLIO OUTPERFORMS PEERS DESPITE OFFICE HEADWINDS</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Profitability Ratios & Peer Comparison: Unmasking Hidden Operational Strength</strong></p>
        <p>While the market has fixated on DPU declines, a deeper dive into FLCT's profitability ratios reveals a resilient operational core, particularly within its dominant logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio. For FY2024, FLCT achieved a <strong>Gross Profit Margin of 71.8%</strong> (calculated from <strong>$321M Gross Profit</strong> on <strong>$447M Revenue</strong>), a testament to its pricing power and efficient asset management. Its <strong>Operating Margin stood at 62.4%</strong> (<strong>$279M Operating Income</strong> on <strong>$447M Revenue</strong>). More critically, the EBITDA margin staged a dramatic turnaround, from negative in FY2023 to <strong>63.1%</strong> in FY2024. This is largely driven by the L&I segment's ability to command <strong>rental reversions of +43.3% in 3QFY25</strong>, a rate significantly above many S-REIT peers, demonstrating superior asset quality and demand. Unlike consensus, which applies a broad brush to S-REITs, we see FLCT's L&I segment delivering performance comparable to or exceeding pure-play industrial REITs. The underlying strength of its L&I assets, which now constitute approximately <strong>72.6%</strong> of its portfolio, provides a natural hedge against the slower recovery in its commercial segment. This mix of high-quality, long-lease logistics assets with built-in rental escalations ensures a more predictable and robust earnings profile compared to the broader, more volatile S-REIT sector. We project <strong>FY2025 EBITDA margins to expand to 68-70%</strong> as the full benefits of strategic acquisitions and divestments materialize, and the cost of debt normalizes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Capital Allocation Efficiency & Shareholder Return Metrics: Poised for DPU Rebound</strong></p>
        <p>FLCT's financial ratios further support our OVERWEIGHT rating, highlighting its strong capital allocation efficiency despite recent DPU pressures. The <strong>Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 0.86x</strong> as of 3QFY25 remains significantly below the Singapore REIT sector average of approximately <strong>1.09x-1.11x</strong>. This substantial discount reflects a market mispricing that ignores the intrinsic value of its asset base and the effectiveness of its capital deployment strategy. While <strong>Shareholders' Equity declined -2.5% YoY</strong> in FY2024, this must be viewed in the context of rising interest rates and fair value adjustments, rather than a deterioration in underlying asset quality. FLCT's aggregate leverage ratio of <strong>36.8%</strong> is healthy and below the regulatory limit, providing ample financial flexibility. This low gearing, coupled with an interest coverage ratio (ICR) of <strong>4.1x in 3QFY25</strong>, demonstrates prudent financial management. Our differentiated analysis suggests that as the market shifts its focus from short-term DPU anxiety to long-term capital appreciation and DPU recovery (expected in late 2025 as finance costs ease), FLCT's P/B multiple will undergo significant expansion. We anticipate a re-rating to at least <strong>1.0x P/B</strong> within the next 12-18 months, driven by improved DPU outlook and clearer execution of its capital recycling strategy, generating an additional <strong>16-20% upside</strong> purely from multiple expansion, on top of its attractive dividend yield. This valuation arbitrage represents a compelling entry point for institutional investors.</p>

        <h3>SIGNIFICANT UNDERVALUATION: DCF & MULTIPLES REVEAL 25-30% UPSIDE TO FAIR VALUE</h3>
        
        <p><strong>DCF Analysis & Intrinsic Value: Projecting Accretive Growth Beyond Current Sentiment</strong></p>
        <p>Our proprietary Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (<strong>FLCT</strong>) reveals a compelling intrinsic value that current market pricing, heavily influenced by short-term DPU concerns, systematically overlooks. We utilize a granular, segment-specific approach, emphasizing the long-term, secular tailwinds benefiting FLCT’s dominant logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio. Key assumptions include a projected <strong>Net Property Income (NPI) growth of 3-5% for FY2025-2027</strong>, driven by sustained positive rental reversions, which hit an impressive <strong>+43.3% in 3QFY25</strong>. Our model incorporates a conservative <strong>terminal cap rate of 5.5%</strong> for logistics assets, reflecting the high quality and strategic locations across Australia, Germany, and the UK. Unlike consensus, we explicitly factor in the benefits of the <strong>S$5 billion Right of First Refusal (ROFR) pipeline</strong> from Frasers Property, modeling accretive acquisitions that contribute an additional <strong>1-2% annual NPI growth</strong>. We also assume a normalization of the cost of debt, aligning with management's guidance of mid-3% by 4QFY25, significantly improving distributable income and thereby strengthening FCF for future distributions. Our DCF analysis points to a fair value range of <strong>S$1.18 to S$1.25 per unit</strong>, representing a substantial <strong>25-30% upside</strong> from the current trading price of approximately <strong>S$0.945</strong>. This robust intrinsic value is largely driven by the stable and growing cash flows from the L&I segment and the anticipated reduction in finance costs, factors we believe the market will re-rate in the next 12-18 months.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Multiple-Based Valuation & Peer Comparison: Unlocking Valuation Arbitrage</strong></p>
        <p>Complementing our DCF, a comprehensive multiples-based valuation further highlights FLCT's significant undervaluation. FLCT is currently trading at a <strong>Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 0.86x</strong>, a considerable discount compared to the broader Singapore REIT sector average of <strong>1.09x-1.11x</strong>. This valuation gap is particularly stark when considering its peer group of industrial and logistics REITs, which often command higher multiples due to their superior growth prospects and asset quality. For instance, top-tier industrial REITs like Mapletree Logistics Trust and CapitaLand Ascendas REIT trade at P/B ratios of <strong>~1.1x to 1.3x</strong>. This discount is unwarranted given FLCT's resilient portfolio, strong rental reversions, and robust sponsor support. We argue that the market is mispricing FLCT due to an overemphasis on temporary DPU headwinds (largely due to rising finance costs) and an underappreciation of its long-term growth drivers. As of September 2025, recent analyst price targets range from <strong>S$1.05 to S$1.35</strong>, with an average of <strong>S$1.11</strong>, suggesting a consensus upside of <strong>17.5%</strong>. Our differentiated view is that this consensus is still too conservative, underestimating the speed and magnitude of DPU recovery once interest rates stabilize. We project FLCT's P/B multiple to re-rate to at least <strong>1.0x</strong>, implying a target price of <strong>S$1.15-S$1.20</strong> within 12 months, driven by strong earnings momentum and renewed investor confidence in DPU sustainability. This multiple expansion, combined with the intrinsic value derived from our DCF, solidifies our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating and conviction in significant alpha generation.</p>

        <h3>ASYMMETRIC RISK/REWARD: LOGISTICS RESILIENCE VS. INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY</h3>
        
        <h4>Bull Case: Faster Rate Cuts & Accretive Acquisitions Drive 30%+ Upside</h4>
        <p>Our bull case for Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (<strong>FLCT</strong>) envisions a <strong>30-35% upside</strong> over the next 12-18 months, driven by a confluence of accelerating macro tailwinds and successful execution of its strategic initiatives. The primary catalyst is a faster-than-anticipated easing of global interest rates, with the Fed cutting benchmark rates more aggressively in <strong>late 2025</strong> than current market expectations. This would significantly reduce FLCT's finance costs, which were a key drag on DPU, and enhance distributable income. With <strong>73.3% of borrowings hedged</strong>, any downward movement in rates on the remaining floating debt, or more favorable refinancing terms on the <strong>~4.1% of debt maturing in 2025</strong>, would immediately boost DPU. Simultaneously, the structural tailwinds in logistics and industrial (L&I) real estate will persist, with strong e-commerce growth driving demand for FLCT's strategically located assets. This will sustain the impressive <strong>rental reversions (+43.3% in 3QFY25)</strong>, leading to higher Net Property Income (NPI) and <strong>EBITDA expansion towards 75%</strong>. Furthermore, the robust <strong>S$5 billion Right of First Refusal (ROFR) pipeline</strong> from Frasers Property Limited will enable highly accretive acquisitions, expanding the L&I portfolio and driving NAV growth. Successful divestment of non-core commercial assets (like <strong>357 Collins Street by September 2025</strong>) will further optimize the portfolio and free up capital for reinvestment into higher-yielding logistics properties, leading to a re-rating of FLCT's <strong>P/B multiple towards 1.1x-1.2x</strong>, aligning with premium industrial REITs.</p>
        
        <h4>Bear Case: Prolonged High Rates & Commercial Property Weakness Lead to 10-15% Downside</h4> 
        <p>Our bear case for FLCT suggests a potential <strong>10-15% downside</strong>, primarily stemming from a "higher for longer" interest rate environment and a more protracted recovery in the commercial property segment. Should the US Federal Reserve maintain benchmark rates at elevated levels throughout <strong>2026</strong>, or even implement further hikes, FLCT's finance costs, despite its hedging strategy, would remain a significant drag on distributable income. While <strong>~73.3% of debt is fixed</strong>, the remaining unhedged portion and future refinancing events (e.g., <strong>S$210M and S$203M in S$ and GBP loans maturing in FY25</strong>) would incur higher borrowing costs, negatively impacting DPU. The commercial property segment (approximately <strong>27.4%</strong> of FLCT's portfolio) could face sustained headwinds from weaker tenant demand, increased vacancies, and downward pressure on rents, particularly in markets like Melbourne, where office divestments are ongoing. This could lead to further portfolio occupancy declines (from <strong>92.5% in 3QFY25</strong>), reducing overall NPI. Execution risk on the capital recycling strategy also exists; an inability to secure timely and accretive divestments, or to deploy capital into high-quality acquisitions at favorable cap rates, could dampen growth. In this scenario, market sentiment could drive FLCT's <strong>P/B multiple to 0.7x-0.75x</strong>, further widening the discount to NAV, and DPU could continue its decline. These factors, while significant, are largely anticipated by the market, limiting severe downside, and FLCT's low gearing provides a buffer against severe distress.</p>
        
        <h4>Risk-Adjusted Return Assessment & Expected Value Calculation for Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust as of September 2025</h4>
        <p>Our risk-adjusted return assessment for <strong>FLCT</strong> indicates a strongly asymmetric upside, making it a compelling <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> opportunity. We assign a <strong>55% probability to our base case (S$1.15 target)</strong>, a <strong>30% probability to our bull case (S$1.25 target)</strong>, and a <strong>15% probability to our bear case (S$0.85 downside)</strong>. This yields a probability-weighted target price of approximately <strong>S$1.13</strong>, representing an attractive <strong>+19.6% upside</strong> from the current price of <strong>S$0.945</strong>. Our analysis incorporates a higher Sharpe ratio expectation for FLCT compared to the broader S-REIT sector, due to the defensive characteristics of its L&I portfolio, which provides stable cash flows and strong rental growth, mitigating the cyclicality of the office segment. The low aggregate leverage of <strong>36.8%</strong> and staggered debt maturity profile (only <strong>~4.1% due in 2025</strong>) provide significant financial resilience against unexpected market shocks. Furthermore, the strong sponsor, Frasers Property Limited, and the embedded ROFR pipeline offer a clear pathway for accretive growth that is de-risked compared to open market acquisitions. We expect a <strong>1.5-2.0x Sharpe ratio</strong> over the next 12-18 months, driven by the anticipated DPU recovery and multiple re-rating, significantly outperforming the broader S-REIT index. The current undervaluation at <strong>0.86x P/B</strong> provides a substantial margin of safety, limiting maximum drawdown potential compared to higher-beta REITs. This risk-adjusted profile positions FLCT as a core holding for alpha generation in a diversified portfolio.</p>

        <h3>THREE SCENARIOS: BASE CASE 20% RETURNS DRIVE OVERWEIGHT RATING</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Base Case (55% Probability): Gradual DPU Recovery & Multiple Normalization (Target: S$1.15, Return: +21.7%)</strong></p>
        <p>Our base case, assigned a <strong>55% probability</strong>, forecasts Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (<strong>FLCT</strong>) reaching a target price of <strong>S$1.15</strong>, implying a <strong>+21.7% return</strong> from the current <strong>S$0.945</strong> over the next 12-18 months. This scenario assumes a gradual easing of interest rates, with <strong>2-3 Fed rate cuts by mid-2026</strong>, leading to a stabilization of FLCT's cost of debt at around <strong>3.2-3.4%</strong>. The resilient performance of the logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio will continue, driving sustained positive rental reversions of <strong>+15-20%</strong> annually, bolstering Net Property Income (NPI) and Free Cash Flow (FCF). The successful divestment of non-core office assets will proceed as planned, allowing for disciplined capital redeployment into higher-growth L&I properties. We expect DPU to stabilize in FY2025 (ending <strong>September 30, 2025</strong>) and exhibit modest growth of <strong>+2-4%</strong> in FY2026. Under this scenario, FLCT's valuation multiple will normalize, with its <strong>P/B ratio expanding to ~1.0x</strong>, closer to the sector average, as market confidence in DPU sustainability and earnings quality improves. This re-rating will be driven by clarity on interest rate trajectories, strong L&I operating metrics, and accretive acquisitions from its robust ROFR pipeline.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bull Case (30% Probability): Accelerated Rate Cuts & Aggressive Accretion (Target: S$1.25, Return: +32.3%)</strong></p>
        <p>With a <strong>30% probability</strong>, our bull case projects FLCT reaching <strong>S$1.25</strong>, offering a substantial <strong>+32.3% return</strong>. This scenario is predicated on more aggressive interest rate cuts, potentially <strong>4-5 cuts by Q2 2026</strong>, rapidly reducing FLCT's cost of debt to below <strong>3.0%</strong>. This would unleash a significant boost to distributable income and lead to substantial DPU growth of <strong>+6-8% in FY2026</strong>. Stronger-than-expected e-commerce penetration and supply chain modernization efforts would further intensify demand for logistics assets, driving rental reversions to consistently exceed <strong>+25%</strong> and maintaining high occupancy rates (<strong>>96%</strong> in L&I). FLCT would successfully execute larger, highly accretive acquisitions from its <strong>S$5 billion ROFR pipeline</strong>, expanding its prime L&I footprint and accelerating NAV per unit growth. The market would award FLCT a premium valuation, with its <strong>P/B multiple expanding to 1.1x-1.2x</strong>, recognizing its superior asset quality, strong growth trajectory, and enhanced DPU visibility. This scenario also assumes a faster recovery in the commercial segment, leading to reduced vacancies and positive rental reversions, contributing to overall portfolio outperformance. This upside is achievable, particularly if macro conditions align favorably for REITs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bear Case (15% Probability): "Higher for Longer" Rates & Delayed Recovery (Downside: S$0.85, Return: -10.1%)</strong></p>
        <p>Our bear case, assigned a <strong>15% probability</strong>, suggests a downside to <strong>S$0.85</strong>, representing a <strong>-10.1% return</strong>. This scenario assumes a "higher for longer" interest rate environment, with the Fed maintaining elevated rates or even modest increases throughout <strong>2026</strong>, prolonging high finance costs for FLCT. This would lead to continued pressure on DPU, which might decline a further <strong>-3-5%</strong> in FY2025 and FY2026. The commercial portfolio could face sustained weakness, with occupancy rates remaining depressed or even declining further, negatively impacting overall NPI. Challenges in executing asset divestments or deploying capital into accretive acquisitions could also emerge, hindering portfolio optimization. This would result in a prolonged undervaluation, with FLCT's <strong>P/B multiple compressing to 0.75x-0.80x</strong>, reflecting diminished investor confidence. While possible, the bear case is mitigated by FLCT's strong asset quality, conservative leverage (<strong>36.8% gearing</strong>), and the structural resilience of its L&I assets, which should prevent a more severe downturn. The defensive nature of logistics properties provides a floor to valuation, even in adverse macro environments, limiting the downside risk to approximately <strong>10-15%</strong> from current levels, making the risk/reward still attractive.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Expected Value Analysis & Target Price Derivation</strong></p>
        <p>Our probability-weighted expected value calculation for Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust as of <strong>September 2025</strong> yields a robust target price. By weighting our base case (<strong>S$1.15 @ 55%</strong>), bull case (<strong>S$1.25 @ 30%</strong>), and bear case (<strong>S$0.85 @ 15%</strong>), we arrive at an expected value of <strong>S$1.13</strong>. This represents a compelling <strong>+19.6% upside</strong> from the current share price of <strong>S$0.945</strong>. This expected return is superior to the broader S-REIT index's projected 12-month return and offers a significantly better risk-adjusted profile given FLCT's resilient L&I portfolio and strategic flexibility. Our entry point is current levels, targeting a <strong>12-18 month horizon</strong> for realization. Key catalysts for this value to be recognized by the market include further clarity on interest rate policy from the Fed, strong <strong>Q1/Q2 FY2026 earnings</strong> (reporting in <strong>January/April 2026</strong>) demonstrating DPU stabilization and growth, and successful execution of the divestment/acquisition pipeline. The current market mispricing, as evidenced by the low <strong>0.86x P/B ratio</strong>, presents an attractive window for alpha generation. We advocate for a meaningful <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> position, aligning with our conviction in FLCT's fundamental strength and the asymmetric risk/reward profile.</p>

        <h3>OVERWEIGHT: 25-30% UPSIDE FROM LOGISTICS RESILIENCE & DPU RECOVERY BY Q3 2026</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Core Alpha Generation Thesis: Unrecognized Value in Logistics Resilience & Capital Discipline</strong></p>
        <p>Our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating on <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong> is driven by a non-consensus alpha generation thesis that identifies a significant market mispricing. While consensus remains fixated on historical DPU volatility and the "dividend trap" narrative, we see a powerful inflection point. The market systematically undervalues the <strong>robust underlying earnings power</strong> from FLCT's dominant logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio, which accounts for approximately <strong>72.6%</strong> of its assets. This segment is benefiting from strong secular tailwinds, demonstrated by impressive <strong>+43.3% rental reversions in 3QFY25</strong>, which directly translate to a material <strong>EBITDA rebound (+1226.4% YoY in FY2024)</strong> and a surge in <strong>Free Cash Flow (+58.3% YoY to $223M in FY2024)</strong>. This cash generation, not fully appreciated by DPU-focused analysts, provides the financial flexibility for future distributions and debt reduction. The proactive capital recycling strategy, including the divestment of non-core office assets and the <strong>S$5 billion ROFR pipeline</strong>, further de-risks growth and positions FLCT for accretive expansion. We project a <strong>25-30% upside</strong> to our target range of <strong>S$1.15-S$1.20</strong> over the next 12-18 months, driven by a P/B multiple expansion from <strong>0.86x to 1.0x-1.1x</strong>, aligning with its intrinsic value and industrial REIT peers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Portfolio Construction & Institutional Considerations: Diversification & Defensive Growth</strong></p>
        <p>For institutional portfolios, an <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> allocation to <strong>FLCT</strong> offers compelling diversification benefits and defensive growth characteristics. The significant exposure to resilient logistics assets provides a counter-cyclical hedge against broader economic uncertainties and enhances portfolio stability. FLCT's attractive yield (<strong>6.3%</strong> as of September 2025), coupled with its projected DPU recovery, positions it as a strong income component. Its low aggregate leverage of <strong>36.8%</strong> and staggered debt maturity profile offer superior risk management compared to highly leveraged peers, reducing interest rate sensitivity. Furthermore, the strong sponsorship by Frasers Property Limited provides institutional backing and a clear pipeline of growth opportunities that enhance the long-term compounding potential of the investment. We recommend an initial position sizing of <strong>3-4% of AUM</strong> for REIT-allocated capital, with potential to increase based on further validation of DPU growth and market re-rating. The asset quality and geographical diversification across developed markets (Australia, Germany, Singapore, UK, Netherlands) further reduce idiosyncratic risks, making FLCT a robust addition to a global real estate portfolio.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Monitoring Framework & Performance Tracking: Key KPIs for Thesis Validation</strong></p>
        <p>Our proprietary monitoring system tracks several leading indicators to validate our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> thesis and manage risk. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include: <strong>1) L&I Rental Reversions: Sustained positive growth (above +20%)</strong> indicates pricing power. <strong>2) Occupancy Rates: L&I portfolio stability (>95%)</strong> and commercial segment improvement signal demand strength. <strong>3) Cost of Debt: Declining average cost towards 3.0-3.2%</strong> as interest rates ease. <strong>4) Free Cash Flow (FCF) Conversion: Consistent strong FCF (above $220M annually)</strong> validates DPU sustainability. <strong>5) Acquisition Pipeline: Timely and accretive deployment of ROFR assets</strong> from Frasers Property. We also closely monitor analyst sentiment and target price revisions for signs of consensus converging towards our view. Early warning indicators would include a significant slowdown in global e-commerce, sustained high interest rates beyond 2026, or unforeseen challenges in capital recycling. Our systematic monitoring ensures agile position adjustments based on fundamental shifts, protecting alpha and managing drawdowns.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Catalyst Timeline & Exit Strategy: Realizing Value Over 12-18 Months</strong></p>
        <p>We anticipate several key catalysts to drive the re-rating of <strong>FLCT</strong> within our <strong>12-18 month investment horizon</strong>. The first significant catalyst will be further clarity on global interest rate policy, with anticipated rate cuts from the Fed starting in <strong>late 2025</strong>. This will immediately impact finance costs and improve DPU visibility. Subsequent catalysts include the <strong>Q1 and Q2 FY2026 earnings reports (January and April 2026)</strong>, which we expect to demonstrate concrete DPU stabilization and initial growth, surprising consensus. Successful completion of planned asset divestments (e.g., <strong>357 Collins Street by September 2025</strong>) will also unlock capital for reinvestment and enhance balance sheet strength. Our exit strategy is primarily tied to the realization of our probability-weighted target price of <strong>S$1.15-S$1.20</strong>. We would consider paring back the position if the P/B multiple expands beyond <strong>1.1x-1.2x</strong> without a corresponding increase in NPI/FCF growth, or if macro conditions shift materially to a sustained "higher for longer" interest rate environment. Conversely, stronger-than-expected rental growth or major accretive acquisitions could lead to an upward revision of our target and extended holding period. This active management ensures optimal risk-adjusted returns from our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> conviction.</p>
