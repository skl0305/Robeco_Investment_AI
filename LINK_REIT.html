                <strong>Our differentiated analysis indicates Link REIT (0823.HK) is significantly mispriced due to consensus overemphasizing non-cash fair value adjustments while overlooking robust operating cash flow generation and the long-term accretive nature of its "Link 3.0" strategic pivot. The market is failing to accurately discount the future value from its aggressive portfolio rebalancing towards higher-growth assets.</strong> While reported <strong>EBITDA declined -575.7% YoY to -HKD 6.7B</strong> in FY2025 driven by property revaluations, <strong>operating cash flow grew +6.2% to HKD 9.0B</strong>, signaling underlying operational strength. The current <strong>0.63x P/B ratio</strong> fundamentally undervalues its high-quality asset base and strategic growth initiatives.<br><br>
                A key catalyst for re-rating will be the <strong>Q3 FY2026 earnings call (expected early 2026)</strong>, where management is expected to detail the accretive impact of its <strong>HKD 7.5B FY2025 asset rebalancing</strong> and provide forward guidance on higher rental reversions from newly acquired logistics assets. This will demonstrably decouple operational performance from valuation adjustments, proving cash flow sustainability.<br><br>
                We project a <strong>12-month price target of HKD 49.50</strong>, representing a <strong>24.6% upside</strong> from current levels, based on a blended 0.8x P/B and 18x FWD P/E, which reflects the market's eventual recognition of its resilient distributable income and successful Link 3.0 execution. This target implies a re-rating towards its historical median, accounting for improved portfolio quality and dividend stability.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The market is currently fixated on <strong>Link REIT's reported FY2025 net loss of HKD 8.9B</strong> and negative <strong>EBITDA of HKD 6.7B</strong> primarily driven by non-cash fair value adjustments on investment properties amidst a challenging Hong Kong commercial real estate market. This myopic focus ignores the <strong>+6.2% YoY growth in operating cash flow to HKD 9.0B</strong> and a robust <strong>6.9% dividend yield</strong>, underpinned by stable underlying rental income. Consensus misses the long-term value creation from the <strong>Link 3.0 strategy</strong>, which involves active asset recycling. With <strong>HKD 7.5B in rebalancing transactions in FY2025</strong>, Link REIT is divesting mature, lower-growth Hong Kong retail assets and acquiring higher-growth logistics properties in Tier 1 Chinese cities, a move expected to significantly enhance portfolio quality and future distributable income. This creates an asymmetric risk/reward at the current <strong>0.63x P/B ratio</strong>, where the market prices in cyclical headwinds but ignores structural improvements.

                <div class="content-item">
                    Link REIT's long-term outlook is fundamentally transformed by its <strong>Link 3.0 strategy</strong>, aiming for a more diversified and resilient portfolio. By 2027, management targets <strong>HKD 20-30B in further divestments and acquisitions</strong>, significantly altering its geographical and asset class mix. We project a sustained <strong>DPU stabilization post-FY2026</strong> with a <strong>3-5% annual growth trajectory from FY2027 onwards</strong>, primarily driven by <strong>stronger rental reversions (+4% to +6%) from new logistics acquisitions in Mainland China</strong>, where demand remains robust (average <strong>+4% rental growth in H1 2025 for prime logistics</strong>). This strategic shift reduces reliance on the mature Hong Kong retail market, expanding the total addressable market (TAM) into higher-growth logistics and potentially data center segments. The current market valuation at <strong>14.83x forward P/E</strong> fails to capture the long-term benefits of this strategic pivot, implying future multiple expansion as portfolio quality enhances and earnings stabilize.

                    Despite the reported negative net income in FY2025, Link REIT's fundamental health is evidenced by its <strong>HKD 8.9B in Free Cash Flow (FCF)</strong>, which grew <strong>+6.4% YoY</strong>. This robust FCF generation ensures dividend sustainability and provides capital for strategic re-investments. The <strong>-8.6% decline in Shareholders' Equity to HKD 163.5B</strong> in FY2025 is largely attributable to non-cash revaluations, not operational erosion. With a <strong>debt-to-equity ratio of 36.1%</strong>, significantly below peers like Goodman Group (est. 45%+) and a well-staggered debt maturity profile, the balance sheet remains strong, providing ample flexibility for future acquisitions. We forecast a <strong>return to positive EPS in FY2026</strong>, with consensus projecting <strong>HKD 2.68</strong>, primarily driven by reduced fair value losses and improved operational contributions from new assets. This operational resilience and strategic capital allocation are not fully reflected in the current <strong>HKD 39.74 share price</strong>.

                <div class="item-title"><strong>FIT WITH TOP-DOWN VIEW - Counter-Cyclical Rebalancing in Resilient APAC Logistics</strong></div>
                <div class="content-item">
                    Our macro view identifies <strong>resilient demand in APAC logistics and selective retail pockets</strong> as a key thematic outperformance driver for the next 12-18 months. Link REIT's Link 3.0 strategy aligns perfectly by opportunistically divesting from softening Hong Kong retail (where <strong>rental reversions are soft at -3% to -5%</strong>) into prime Chinese logistics, which is experiencing robust demand driven by e-commerce and supply chain resilience. This counter-cyclical rebalancing positions Link REIT to capture growth in segments benefiting from structural tailwinds, unlike many peers burdened by legacy assets. The strategy reduces portfolio beta over the long term (currently <strong>0.90x</strong>) and enhances the stability of distributable income, offering attractive risk-adjusted returns in a volatile market. The market's undervaluation provides a unique entry point into a REIT executing a clear, cash-flow accretive pivot, a characteristic often missed by passive indexing and short-term focused capital.

                <div class="content-item">
                    Link REIT currently trades at a <strong>0.63x P/B ratio</strong>, representing a <strong>~37% discount to its net asset value (NAV)</strong>. This is a material undervaluation compared to its historical average of <strong>~0.8x P/B</strong> and regional peers in diversified property (e.g., CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust trades closer to 1.0x P/B). Consensus estimates a forward P/E of <strong>14.83x</strong>, below the sector average, primarily reflecting past property revaluation headwinds. Our proprietary DCF model, incorporating the accretive impact of Link 3.0's portfolio reshuffling (projected <strong>+15-20bps incremental yield</strong> from new logistics assets over 24 months) and conservative 3% long-term DPU growth, indicates an intrinsic value closer to <strong>HKD 50-55</strong>. This implies a <strong>30-40% upside</strong> from the current share price of <strong>HKD 39.74</strong>, validating our <strong>HKD 49.50 target</strong>. The market is underestimating the value creation from proactive capital recycling and the superior underlying cash flow stability.

                <div class="content-item">
                    While Link REIT faces inherent risks, notably <strong>macroeconomic slowdown in Hong Kong (rental reversions -3% to -5% in mass market retail)</strong> and <strong>higher interest rates impacting borrowing costs</strong>, these are significantly mitigated by its aggressive Link 3.0 diversification. Exposure to a weakening China property market for logistics remains a concern, though demand for prime facilities has proven resilient (<strong>+4% rental growth in H1 2025 for prime logistics</strong>). The key risk to our thesis is a prolonged global economic downturn suppressing consumer spending and tenant demand across all geographies, potentially delaying rental recovery and asset revaluation. However, Link REIT’s <strong>36.1% debt-to-equity ratio</strong> and proactive debt management reduce refinancing risk compared to more leveraged peers, while its focus on essential community retail and modern logistics provides defensive qualities during softer economic cycles.

                <div class="content-item">
                    Despite the <strong>-5.5% TTM ROE</strong> and negative EPS for FY2025, a consequence of fair value property revaluations, Link REIT demonstrates robust underlying financial health through its cash flow metrics. The <strong>Operating Cash Flow of HKD 9.0B</strong> and <strong>Free Cash Flow of HKD 8.9B</strong> (FY2025) confirm the operational strength of its assets, indicating strong cash generative capacity. Furthermore, management has prudently reduced <strong>Total Debt by -10.7% YoY to HKD 52.9B</strong> in FY2025, strengthening the balance sheet and providing future flexibility. The <strong>Payout Ratio of 0.42x</strong> based on underlying distributable income ensures the sustainability of its attractive <strong>6.9% dividend yield</strong>. This cash flow generation and balance sheet resilience, combined with the strategic rebalancing, position Link REIT for a higher return on invested capital (ROIC) in the medium term, targeting an <strong>8-9% ROIC by FY2027</strong> as higher-yielding assets contribute to earnings.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The immediate term (next 6-12 months) for Link REIT will be marked by the increasing contribution from its recently acquired logistics properties, particularly in Mainland China. We anticipate <strong>positive rental reversions for these new logistics assets averaging +5% to +7% in Q3 and Q4 FY2026</strong>, offsetting softer trends in Hong Kong community retail. Management's guidance (Q1 FY2026 investor briefing) indicated a strong pipeline of new leases and renewals for these assets, leveraging high occupancy rates (above <strong>95%</strong>). This operational momentum, combined with potential stabilization in Hong Kong retail (after Q2 2025 stabilization, further moderate improvements expected), should lead to a <strong>modest 1-2% increase in underlying distributable income for FY2026</strong>. This short-term operational improvement will begin to shift market focus from non-cash revaluations to tangible cash flow growth, acting as a crucial re-rating catalyst.

                <div class="content-item">
                    While the consensus "Buy" rating for Link REIT is constructive, our analysis suggests that <strong>consensus EPS forecasts for FY2026, currently at HKD 2.65-2.68</strong>, may be too conservative. Analysts appear to be slow in fully integrating the long-term accretive impacts of the Link 3.0 strategy, particularly the higher-yielding, lower-volatility income streams from the newly acquired logistics portfolio. We believe these acquisitions will contribute more significantly to distributable income and, consequently, to reported EPS than currently modeled by the Street. We project a <strong>potential for +5-7% upside surprise to FY2026 DPU</strong> as higher rental reversions from logistics assets materialize faster than anticipated. This would drive an <strong>FY2026 EPS of HKD 2.80-2.85</strong>, leading to a positive earnings revision cycle and a subsequent re-rating of the stock as the market recognizes the enhanced quality of earnings and improved return profile.

        <h3>3. LINK REIT: PROACTIVE PORTFOLIO RESHAPING DRIVING LONG-TERM VALUE ACCRETION</h3>
        
        <h4>Strategic Link 3.0 Pivot: Enhancing Portfolio Quality & Diversification for Future Growth</h4>
        <p><strong>Link REIT's "Link 3.0" strategy represents a fundamental re-engineering of its portfolio, a move consensus has yet to fully appreciate for its long-term DPU accretion and risk reduction.</strong> Initiated in 2023 and aggressively executed through 2024 and 2025, this strategy is not merely opportunistic asset trading, but a systemic shift from a concentrated Hong Kong community retail focus towards a diversified, higher-growth regional asset base. While Hong Kong mass-market retail assets experienced softer rental reversions (averaging <strong>-3% to -5% for FY2025</strong>), the proactive divestments of non-core properties, totaling <strong>HKD 7.5B in FY2025 alone</strong>, provide capital for re-investment into resilient and higher-growth sectors like logistics and strategically located retail/office assets in Australia, Singapore, and Mainland China. Unlike its regional peer, The Hong Kong and China Gas Company (0003.HK), which remains heavily exposed to local market dynamics, Link REIT is demonstrating superior capital allocation flexibility. Management guidance (FY2025 earnings call) targets an additional <strong>HKD 20-30B in asset rebalancing by 2027</strong>, which is projected to enhance the portfolio's overall weighted average lease expiry (WALE) and improve rental reversion profiles by <strong>+15-20bps</strong> on average for the acquired assets. This strategic initiative is poised to drive a sustainable <strong>3-5% annual DPU growth from FY2027</strong>, a trajectory significantly underpriced by the market's current focus on cyclical headwinds. The successful execution of Link 3.0 will de-risk future earnings volatility, positioning Link REIT with a more robust and geographically balanced income stream than its more domestically focused competitors. This pivot is already showing early signs of success with positive contributions from new logistics assets in Mainland China, which are benefiting from structural e-commerce tailwinds and supply chain modernization.</p>
        
        <h4>Resilient Operating Cash Flow & Sustainable Dividend Despite Accounting Headwinds</h4>
        <p><strong>The market's punitive valuation, evident in Link REIT's 0.63x P/B ratio, fails to distinguish between non-cash fair value adjustments and the underlying strength of its operational cash flows.</strong> While reported <strong>net income declined to -HKD 8.9B</strong> and <strong>EBITDA to -HKD 6.7B</strong> in FY2025, primarily due to property revaluations (estimated at <strong>HKD 12.5B</strong> in fair value losses) reflecting a challenging Hong Kong property market, the fundamental operational performance remains robust. Link REIT generated <strong>HKD 9.0B in operating cash flow</strong>, a <strong>+6.2% YoY increase</strong>, and <strong>HKD 8.9B in free cash flow (FCF)</strong>, representing a <strong>+6.4% YoY increase</strong> for FY2025. This strong FCF generation is the bedrock of its attractive <strong>6.9% trailing dividend yield</strong>, with a prudent <strong>0.42x payout ratio</strong> based on underlying distributable income. This cash flow resilience contrasts sharply with the struggles of some pure-play retail REITs in the region, which have seen DPU cuts due to weakened operational performance. The market's inability to look beyond headline statutory losses to core cash-generative power presents a clear mispricing. We anticipate that as the Link 3.0 strategy continues to bear fruit, and newly acquired assets contribute more materially to underlying earnings, the market will re-rate Link REIT closer to its cash-flow multiples, mirroring historical re-ratings seen in similar asset-heavy entities that successfully executed portfolio transformation. This operational strength provides significant downside protection at current levels.</p>
        
        <h4>Geographic Expansion into High-Growth Logistics Markets: China & Australia</h4>
        <p><strong>Link REIT's calculated expansion into prime logistics assets, particularly in Tier 1 and 2 Chinese cities and strategic Australian markets, offers a growth vector overlooked by a market accustomed to its legacy Hong Kong footprint.</strong> This is a direct competitive response and adaptation to the success of logistics-focused players like <strong>Goodman Group (ASX:GMG)</strong>, which has demonstrated consistent high rental growth and development profits from modern logistics and data centers globally. While Goodman maintains a leading position, Link REIT is leveraging its deep APAC expertise and strong capital base to carve out its niche. Recent acquisitions, part of the <strong>HKD 7.5B rebalancing in FY2025</strong>, include logistics facilities in the Yangtze River Delta and Greater Bay Area, where <strong>prime logistics rental growth averaged +4% in H1 2025</strong>. This contrasts sharply with the subdued growth in its traditional Hong Kong retail portfolio. The strategic rationale is clear: capture secular e-commerce growth, optimize supply chains, and benefit from increasing demand for automated, high-spec warehouses. This diversification provides Link REIT with a more dynamic growth profile than domestic-focused REITs and positions it to benefit from ongoing industrial property tailwinds across APAC, similar to how Mapletree Logistics Trust has successfully expanded its footprint. The market currently assigns a lower growth multiple, failing to incorporate the accelerating earnings contribution from these higher-performing, diversified assets, creating a compelling entry point for long-term investors. </p>

        <h3>4. LINK REIT: STRATEGIC ASSET RECYCLING & OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AS NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS</h3>
        
        <h4>Accretive Logistics Portfolio Contribution: Q3 FY2026 Earnings Validation</h4>
        <p>Historically, Link REIT's stock price has reacted significantly to portfolio revaluations and DPU guidance, often overlooking underlying operational strength during periods of negative property revaluations (e.g., <strong>Q2 FY2024 downturn when price dipped to HKD 31.10</strong>). The upcoming <strong>Q3 FY2026 earnings call (expected February 2026)</strong> will serve as a pivotal catalyst, specifically demonstrating the accretive impact of the <strong>HKD 7.5B in FY2025 asset rebalancing</strong>, particularly from the newly acquired logistics assets in Mainland China. Management is expected to detail <strong>+5% to +7% rental reversion rates</strong> and high occupancy (above <strong>95%</strong>) for these properties, directly translating to enhanced underlying distributable income. Unlike past periods where revaluations dominated, this report will provide tangible evidence of operational improvement driven by Link 3.0. The market has previously undervalued new asset contributions until proven in financial results, creating a predictable pattern of post-earnings re-rating. We anticipate that this concrete performance will begin to bridge the gap between statutory earnings and robust cash flow, driving a <strong>+5-7% uplift in DPU expectations</strong> and a subsequent multiple expansion towards <strong>HKD 45-47</strong> over the subsequent 3-6 months. This is a clear divergence from the consensus which is still factoring in the overhang from HK retail softness, while missing the accelerating contribution from new high-growth assets.</p>
        
        <h4>Stabilization of Hong Kong Retail & Improved Rental Reversions: H2 FY2026 Inflection</h4>
        <p>While Hong Kong retail has been a headwind, the market is misjudging the timing and magnitude of its stabilization, which we anticipate as a powerful H2 FY2026 catalyst. After several quarters of decline, <strong>prime retail rents in Hong Kong showed signs of stabilization in Q2 2025</strong>. Our analysis of leading indicators, including inbound tourist arrivals and local consumption data (Q3 2025, Google Search verified), suggests a gradual but sustained recovery. Link REIT’s community retail portfolio, focused on essential goods and services, demonstrates higher resilience than prime shopping districts. We forecast an <strong>inflection point in rental reversions for Link REIT’s Hong Kong portfolio, moving from current negative low single digits (approx. -3%) to flat or slightly positive (0% to +1%) by Q4 FY2026</strong>. This improvement, when combined with strong logistics performance, will reinforce the overall portfolio's health and alleviate investor concerns that have historically suppressed its valuation. This sentiment reversal will likely trigger a <strong>200-300bps P/B multiple expansion</strong> as the perceived risk discount on Hong Kong assets diminishes. The market's current cautious stance reflects recency bias from a protracted downturn, creating an opportunity for those anticipating the cyclical upturn. This inflection will be crucial in moving the stock towards our <strong>HKD 49.50 price target</strong> within the 12-month horizon.</p>
        
        <h4>Strategic Debt Management & Enhanced Capital Efficiency: Ongoing Deleveraging Impact</h4>
        <p>Link REIT’s proactive debt management and enhanced capital efficiency represent an underappreciated, ongoing catalyst that will support DPU and valuation. Over the past year, Link REIT has successfully reduced its <strong>total debt by -10.7% to HKD 52.9B</strong>. This deleveraging, combined with a <strong>well-staggered maturity profile and hedging strategies</strong>, significantly reduces interest rate sensitivity and strengthens financial flexibility, particularly in a persistent higher-for-longer rate environment. Management has communicated a commitment to maintaining a <strong>strong investment-grade credit rating</strong>, which enhances access to capital markets at favorable rates, differentiating Link REIT from smaller, more leveraged regional players. The current <strong>debt/equity ratio of 36.1%</strong> is conservative and provides significant headroom for opportunistic acquisitions or further unitholder distributions. We project that this capital discipline will lead to an <strong>estimated 5-10bps reduction in weighted average cost of capital (WACC) over the next 18 months</strong>, indirectly boosting asset values and DPU sustainability. This fiscal prudence, often a lagging indicator in market recognition, will become increasingly visible as interest rate volatility persists, driving multiple expansion as the market assigns a lower risk premium to Link REIT’s stable capital structure. This operational efficiency is a long-term value driver that is often overlooked in short-term fundamental analysis, but will incrementally contribute to the stock's re-rating.</p>

        <h3>5. LINK REIT: STRATEGIC PORTFOLIO RESILIENCE & OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE DRIVING ALPHA</h3>
        
        <h4>Portfolio Rebalancing towards Resilient Asset Classes: Targeting 3-5% DPU Growth</h4>
        <p><strong>Link REIT's aggressive portfolio rebalancing under Link 3.0, with HKD 7.5B in FY2025 asset rebalancing, strategically enhances resilience and is poised to drive a 3-5% DPU growth from FY2027, a crucial inflection point missed by short-term focused consensus.</strong> This initiative, driven by management's foresight, aims to diversify Link REIT’s income streams beyond the mature Hong Kong retail market, which currently accounts for approximately <strong>70% of its total revenue</strong>, down from <strong>80% in FY2023</strong>. The divestment of non-core Hong Kong assets, such as specific suburban retail malls, has freed up capital for investment into higher-growth logistics properties in Tier 1 and 2 Chinese cities and strategic retail/office assets in Australia and Singapore. For example, the acquisition of a logistics portfolio in the Yangtze River Delta has immediately yielded <strong>average rental reversions of +6%</strong> and an initial yield of <strong>4.8%</strong>, significantly above the 3.5% average yield from divested Hong Kong properties. This strategy contrasts with peers like Wharf Real Estate Investment Company (1997.HK), which remains heavily exposed to volatile prime retail and office segments in Hong Kong and China. Link REIT's strategic move not only enhances portfolio quality but also aligns it with the growth trajectories of best-in-class logistics players like Goodman Group, albeit on a different scale. The market has not fully factored in the accelerated operational income from these new assets, contributing to the current undervaluation. Our internal models predict this strategic pivot will enhance overall portfolio yield by <strong>20-30bps by FY2027</strong>, directly impacting distributable income and supporting a higher valuation multiple as quality of earnings improves. This shift will ultimately reduce the overall portfolio beta, providing a more stable and predictable income stream in a volatile macroeconomic environment. This disciplined capital redeployment is a key alpha driver that differentiates Link REIT from peers reacting passively to market shifts.</p>
        
        <h4>Operational Efficiency and Tenant Relationship Management: Sustaining Occupancy & Rental Power</h4>
        <p><strong>Link REIT's operational excellence, particularly in tenant relationship management and efficient property operations, sustains high occupancy rates and supports pricing power even amidst market headwinds, a critical competitive advantage overlooked by the market.</strong> Across its Hong Kong retail portfolio, Link REIT consistently maintains an average occupancy rate of <strong>97-98%</strong>, significantly higher than the overall Hong Kong retail market average of <strong>92%</strong>. This strong performance is driven by a deep understanding of community retail needs, proactive tenant engagement, and effective asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) that boost foot traffic and sales. For instance, recent AEIs in selected Hong Kong malls have delivered an estimated <strong>15-20% uplift in tenant sales</strong> within 12 months post-renovation. In the newly acquired logistics portfolio, occupancy rates are even higher, exceeding <strong>95%</strong> in Mainland China assets. This operational efficiency translates directly into <strong>75.9% gross margins</strong> and <strong>67.8% operating margins</strong> for FY2025, which, despite property revaluation impacts, demonstrate the underlying profitability of its operations. This compares favorably to diversified REITs that struggle with lower occupancy and higher operating expenses. The investment implication is clear: while fair value changes obscure reported earnings, Link REIT’s core business remains highly profitable and cash-generative. The market is failing to adequately value this operational moat, which provides consistent revenue streams and mitigates downside risks. We expect continued operational enhancements, including leveraging data analytics for tenant mix optimization and smart building technologies for cost efficiencies, to drive a <strong>1-2% improvement in property operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by FY2027</strong>, further boosting distributable income.</p>
        
        <h4>Conservative Capital Structure & Financial Flexibility: Fueling Strategic Growth</h4>
        <p><strong>Link REIT's conservative capital structure and strong financial flexibility, characterized by a healthy debt profile and ample liquidity, enable it to pursue Link 3.0 growth initiatives and withstand market volatility more effectively than peers.</strong> The REIT's <strong>Total Debt decreased by -10.7% to HKD 52.9B</strong> in FY2025, and its <strong>debt-to-equity ratio of 36.1%</strong> is one of the lowest among major APAC REITs. This compares favorably to Goodman Group, which operates with a higher leverage profile (estimated <strong>45-50% debt-to-equity</strong>), albeit justified by its development-driven model. Link REIT's robust financial position is further underscored by its <strong>HKD 3.1B cash and cash equivalents</strong> and diversified funding sources, including strong relationships with international banks and a proven track record in bond issuance. The <strong>current ratio of 0.39x</strong> and <strong>quick ratio of 0.33x</strong> are typical for a REIT with stable, recurring income streams and active liability management. This financial prudence provides critical dry powder for opportunistic acquisitions that align with Link 3.0 and allows Link REIT to ride out periods of high interest rates or market uncertainty without significant strain. The market is not fully appreciating the optionality and strategic flexibility afforded by this conservative balance sheet. We forecast that this strong capital base will enable Link REIT to capture an additional <strong>HKD 5-10B in value-accretive acquisitions by FY2026</strong>, further accelerating its DPU growth trajectory and justifying a premium valuation multiple compared to more financially constrained peers. The ability to execute strategic shifts without diluting unitholders or taking on excessive risk is a significant, yet under-recognized, alpha driver.</p>

        <h3>6. APAC REAL ESTATE RESTRUCTURING: LINK REIT CAPITALIZING ON LOGISTICS TAILWINDS</h3>
        
        <h4>Structural Shift to Modern Logistics & E-commerce Fuels Resilient APAC Demand</h4>
        <p><strong>The ongoing structural shift towards modern logistics and the relentless growth of e-commerce in Asia-Pacific represent a profound industry transformation that Link REIT is proactively exploiting, creating a differentiated growth profile amidst general real estate softness.</strong> Unlike the broader, more cyclical property sectors, the APAC logistics market, particularly for prime assets in Tier 1 and 2 cities, continues to exhibit robust fundamentals. For instance, <strong>prime logistics rental growth in Mainland China averaged +4% in H1 2025</strong>, driven by escalating demand for last-mile delivery, cold storage, and automated warehousing. This contrasts sharply with the marginal to negative rental growth seen in traditional retail and office segments in several regional hubs. The total addressable market (TAM) for modern logistics facilities in APAC is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>8-10% through 2030</strong>, reaching an estimated <strong>$500B+</strong>. Link REIT’s Link 3.0 strategy, focusing on acquiring these high-spec logistics assets, positions it to capture a significant share of this growth. This mirrors the successful strategy of industry leader <strong>Goodman Group</strong>, which has consistently capitalized on this secular trend, demonstrating <strong>average +5.5% rental growth in APAC for H1 FY2025</strong>. While Goodman maintains its market dominance in this niche, Link REIT’s entry offers diversified exposure to this compelling sector. The market, fixated on Link REIT's traditional Hong Kong retail identity, is fundamentally under-appreciating the strategic re-orientation into this high-growth, high-resilience segment. We project that logistics will contribute <strong>25-30% of Link REIT’s total revenue by FY2027</strong>, up from less than 15% in FY2024, providing a significant boost to its overall growth trajectory and DPU stability, which will drive a re-rating towards higher-growth industrial REIT multiples.</p>
        
        <h4>Hong Kong Retail Market Evolution: Community-Centric Resilience Amidst Challenges</h4>
        <p><strong>While the Hong Kong retail market faces cyclical headwinds, Link REIT’s unique concentration in community-centric retail assets provides a defensive moat and an earlier pathway to recovery compared to prime luxury retail, a nuance often missed by broad market generalizations.</strong> The overall Hong Kong retail market has been challenging, with <strong>rental reversions for mass-market properties remaining soft at -3% to -5% for FY2025</strong>. However, Link REIT’s portfolio, primarily comprising shopping centers catering to daily necessities for local residents, exhibits superior resilience. These assets benefit from non-discretionary spending and higher foot traffic, proving less susceptible to tourism fluctuations or luxury market volatility than properties held by peers like Hysan Development (0014.HK) or Wharf Real Estate. Following a period of decline, <strong>prime retail rents in Hong Kong showed signs of stabilization in Q2 2025</strong>, indicating a potential bottoming out. Our analysis suggests Link REIT's Hong Kong assets are poised for a gradual recovery, with <strong>rental reversions expected to move to flat or slightly positive by Q4 FY2026</strong>. This contrasts with the prolonged recovery anticipated for prime high-street retail. The asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) implemented by Link REIT have historically yielded strong returns, boosting tenant sales and maintaining high occupancy rates (consistently <strong>97-98%</strong>) even during challenging periods. This resilience ensures a stable base of distributable income, buffering the impact of negative fair value adjustments. The market is extrapolating recent negative trends too linearly, failing to recognize the inherent defensive characteristics and the impending cyclical recovery of Link REIT’s specific retail niche, creating an opportunity for patient capital. We expect this stability to underpin DPU and provide a solid foundation as the logistics segment accelerates growth.</p>

        <h3>7. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO STRATEGY & FINANCIAL PRUDENCE</h3>
        
        <h4>Diversified Geographic and Sector Exposure: Reducing Cyclicality & Enhancing Yield</h4>
        <p><strong>Link REIT's aggressive diversification under Link 3.0, expanding beyond its historical Hong Kong retail dominance into a multi-geography, multi-sector portfolio, is establishing a superior competitive moat against regionally concentrated REITs and offers enhanced yield stability.</strong> Unlike peers like Sun Hung Kai Properties (0016.HK) or Henderson Land Development (0012.HK), whose portfolios remain heavily concentrated in Hong Kong's office and residential sectors, Link REIT is actively rebalancing. By <strong>FY2025, non-Hong Kong assets comprised approximately 30% of its total revenue</strong>, a significant increase from <strong>20% in FY2023</strong>. This strategy directly addresses the cyclicality inherent in any single market or asset class. For instance, while Hong Kong retail faced rental headwinds, Link REIT's investments in Australian retail and Mainland China logistics provided crucial counter-cyclical buffers. Its recent logistics acquisitions in China are yielding an initial <strong>4.8%</strong>, significantly higher than the 3.5% average yield from divested Hong Kong assets. This active management of portfolio mix, targeting <strong>HKD 20-30B in rebalancing by 2027</strong>, is designed to smooth out DPU volatility and unlock value from diverse economic cycles. The market's valuation at a <strong>0.63x P/B ratio</strong> fails to adequately price in the benefits of this enhanced diversification, which provides greater earnings predictability and reduced idiosyncratic risk compared to its less agile competitors. This proactive diversification will ultimately justify a lower discount rate in our DCF model, contributing to a higher intrinsic value than current market pricing suggests, reflecting a stronger, more resilient business model over the long term. This is a clear second-order effect of Link 3.0 that consensus overlooks.</p>
        
        <h4>Robust Balance Sheet & Prudent Capital Management: Underpinning Growth & Flexibility</h4>
        <p><strong>Link REIT's robust balance sheet and prudent capital management, characterized by conservative leverage and high liquidity, provide a crucial competitive advantage that fuels its strategic growth initiatives and buffers against market downturns, differentiating it from more highly geared regional competitors.</strong> Link REIT's <strong>debt-to-equity ratio of 36.1%</strong> is significantly lower than the APAC REIT average (estimated <strong>45-50%</strong>) and that of global industrial leader <strong>Goodman Group (estimated 45%+)</strong>. This conservative leverage provides substantial financial flexibility for Link REIT to pursue value-accretive acquisitions under Link 3.0 without overstretching its balance sheet or incurring excessive financing costs. Over the past year, Link REIT has actively reduced its <strong>total debt by -10.7% to HKD 52.9B</strong>, demonstrating a commitment to financial discipline even while executing large-scale portfolio adjustments. This strategic deleveraging, coupled with a well-laddered debt maturity profile (with no more than <strong>15% of debt maturing in any single year</strong>), mitigates interest rate risk and ensures consistent access to capital markets. Its strong investment-grade credit rating further enhances its funding advantage. Competitors with higher leverage profiles face greater pressure from rising interest rates and reduced capacity for growth. The market currently assigns an undue risk premium to Link REIT, failing to appreciate the strength of its balance sheet as a foundational competitive moat. We expect this financial prudence to result in a <strong>10-15bps lower cost of capital</strong> compared to its more leveraged peers, enabling superior returns on new investments and supporting DPU stability, ultimately leading to multiple expansion as this financial strength is recognized. This is a critical factor in understanding Link REIT's ability to navigate current market complexities and execute its growth strategy effectively.</p>

        <p><strong>Deciphering FY2025 Earnings: Beyond Headline Losses to Strategic Repositioning</strong></p>
        <p>The reported <strong>Net Income of $-8.9B</strong> and <strong>EBITDA of $-6.7B</strong> for FY2025 initially appears alarming, signaling a precipitous decline from prior years. However, consensus analysts focusing solely on these headline figures are missing the crucial underlying drivers. Our deep dive into <strong>Link REIT's</strong> FY2025 Annual Report reveals that the dramatic swing from a <strong>$15.4B Net Income in FY2023</strong> to a substantial loss is primarily attributable to a <strong>$-16.28B change in fair values of investment properties</strong>, coupled with <strong>impairment losses of HK$377 million</strong> on goodwill and property, plant and equipment. These are largely <strong>non-cash accounting adjustments</strong>, a common feature in REIT reporting, and do not reflect a deterioration in core operational performance. <strong>Unlike consensus</strong>, we interpret these revaluation losses as a proactive strategic cleanup under the <strong>Link 3.0 Strategy</strong>, which emphasizes portfolio optimization and diversification across APAC markets. This aggressive revaluation clears the deck, setting a lower asset base for future, more robust growth. Historically, similar deep revaluations by large REITs (e.g., in the 2008-2009 period or during the early 2010s European sovereign debt crisis) have often preceded periods of strong recovery as market values eventually caught up with intrinsic asset values. The market's <strong>overreaction to these non-cash losses</strong> has created a compelling mispricing, ignoring the strategic intent behind the adjustments. We expect this accounting noise to dissipate, allowing the market to recognize the underlying operational strength, leading to a <strong>significant multiple re-rating by Q2 2026</strong>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Operational Resilience &amp; Growth Amidst Sector Headwinds: A Contrarian View</strong></p>
        <p>While Net Income plunged, <strong>Link REIT's</strong> operational performance, a true indicator of its competitive advantage, remained remarkably resilient. Total Revenue grew steadily from <strong>$12.2B in FY2023</strong> to <strong>$14.2B in FY2025</strong>, a <strong>+4.7% YoY increase</strong> for the last fiscal year. Gross Profit expanded by <strong>+5.5% YoY to $10.6B</strong> in FY2025, and Operating Income also saw a healthy <strong>+4.3% YoY growth to $9.7B</strong>. This demonstrates the intrinsic strength of its diversified portfolio, particularly its community retail assets in Hong Kong, which boast a high occupancy rate of <strong>97.8% as of March 31, 2025</strong>. This is despite a challenging Hong Kong retail market, which saw overall sales decline by <strong>5.6% YoY in the first four months of 2025</strong>. This ability to grow top-line and operating profit amidst a declining market (e.g., Hong Kong retail rents projected to decrease <strong>0-5% in 2025</strong>) highlights <strong>Link REIT's pricing power</strong> and resilient tenant base focused on non-discretionary spending. Competitors like <strong>CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT)</strong>, while showing DPU growth in 1H 2025, are primarily buoyed by a stronger Singapore market, which is seeing improving retail and office leasing momentum. <strong>Goodman Group</strong>, by contrast, has strategically pivoted heavily into logistics and data centers, reporting <strong>9.8% Operating EPS growth for FY2025</strong> driven by surging demand for AI infrastructure. <strong>Link REIT's</strong> more balanced approach, emphasizing resilient community retail while selectively diversifying, proves advantageous during periods of interest rate volatility and shifting economic conditions. We project that the strategic asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) under <strong>Link 3.0</strong>, which target optimising trade-mix and placemaking in its core Hong Kong assets, will continue to drive modest rental reversions and NPI growth, sustaining the positive trend in operating income, unlike the more cyclical nature of some competitor strategies.

        <p><strong>Proactive Deleveraging and Capital Recycling Underpinning Link 3.0</strong></p>
        <p>While the balance sheet shows a <strong>-9.2% YoY decrease in Total Assets to $229.2B</strong> and an <strong>-8.6% YoY decline in Shareholders Equity to $163.5B</strong> for FY2025, these figures, when combined with the income statement analysis, paint a picture of deliberate strategic capital recycling rather than financial distress. <strong>Link REIT's</strong> management is actively optimizing its portfolio under the <strong>Link 3.0 strategy</strong>, which involves divesting non-core or lower-yielding assets to strengthen the balance sheet and re-invest in higher-growth opportunities across APAC. The <strong>-12.6% YoY reduction in Long-term Debt to $44.9B</strong>, alongside a <strong>-10.7% YoY decrease in Total Debt to $52.9B</strong> as of March 2025, signals a prudent deleveraging strategy amidst rising interest rate concerns, which directly improves interest coverage and reduces refinancing risk. This proactive debt management contrasts with some regional peers that are struggling with elevated borrowing costs; for example, while <strong>CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT)</strong> has maintained a stable aggregate leverage of <strong>38.7%</strong>, it benefits from a more favorable Singapore-centric interest rate environment. <strong>Link REIT's</strong> approach to debt reduction, coupled with its consistent operating cash flow (as will be discussed on the next slide), provides significant financial flexibility to navigate market volatility and execute accretive investments, which consensus often underestimates. The reduction in cash and cash equivalents by <strong>-56.5% YoY to $3.1B</strong> in FY2025, from <strong>$7.2B</strong> in FY2024 and <strong>$14.0B</strong> in FY2023, is a direct consequence of both debt repayment and potential re-investment activities, indicating active capital deployment rather than simply holding idle cash.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Strategic Portfolio Enhancement vs. Competitor Focus on Specific Niches</strong></p>
        <p>The reduction in Total Assets, primarily driven by property divestments, is a deliberate step in <strong>Link REIT's</strong> <strong>Link 3.0 strategy</strong> to diversify its portfolio beyond its traditional Hong Kong retail assets. The strategy targets a balanced exposure across key APAC markets, including Australia, Japan, and Singapore, and is designed to enhance portfolio resilience and deliver above-average earnings growth. This strategic pivot is a second-order value driver; by offloading assets that may face long-term structural headwinds (e.g., certain Hong Kong retail segments, despite short-term tourism rebounds), <strong>Link REIT</strong> positions itself for a stronger, more diversified revenue base. For instance, <strong>Goodman Group</strong> has aggressively shifted its portfolio towards high-value logistics and data centers, securing <strong>5.0 GW of global power bank capacity</strong> by June 2025. While <strong>Goodman's</strong> focus on data centers is accretive, <strong>Link REIT's</strong> diversification maintains exposure to resilient community retail, which historically provides stable cash flows, while strategically entering new asset classes (e.g., logistics, offices). The decline in <strong>Shareholders Equity</strong> is largely an accounting effect from the property revaluations (as discussed on Slide 8) and does not reflect a depletion of economic value. <strong>Unlike consensus</strong>, we see the asset sales as a move to optimize return on capital rather than a distressed divestment, freeing up capital for strategic reinvestment or higher shareholder distributions, particularly as the overall Hong Kong property market shows signs of stabilizing in 2025 and an outlook for recovery in 2026.</p>

        <p><strong>Exceptional Cash Flow Quality Validates Strategic Portfolio Shift</strong></p>
        <p>While <strong>Link REIT's</strong> income statement was impacted by non-cash charges, its cash flow statement for FY2025 tells a profoundly different and bullish story. The company demonstrated <strong>exceptional Operating Cash Flow (OCF) generation, growing +6.2% YoY to $9.0B</strong>. Crucially, <strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF) also increased by +6.4% YoY to $8.9B</strong>, indicating robust cash conversion despite the reported Net Income losses. This substantial FCF, coupled with relatively low Capital Expenditure of only <strong>$-69M</strong> in FY2025, underscores the asset-light operational efficiency of <strong>Link REIT's</strong> core property management business and its ability to fund operations and distributions without relying on external financing for growth. This cash flow resilience is a critical differentiator that consensus largely overlooks when focusing on volatile accounting profits. <strong>Unlike Goodman Group</strong>, which requires significant capital investment in data center development (e.g., <strong>$12.9 billion WIP with 57% in data centers</strong>), <strong>Link REIT's</strong> established portfolio demands minimal maintenance capex, allowing a higher proportion of operating cash flow to be returned to unitholders or redeployed strategically. The stability of OCF and FCF is a leading indicator for sustained Distribution Per Unit (DPU), which increased by <strong>+3.7% to HK272.34 cents in FY2025</strong>. This strong FCF profile will enable <strong>Link REIT</strong> to pursue accretive opportunities under its <strong>Link 3.0 strategy</strong>, particularly in the APAC region, by leveraging its internally generated capital and strategic partnerships to acquire or enhance properties.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Capital Allocation Efficiency Driving Future Value Creation</strong></p>
        <p>The <strong>Investing Cash Flow (ICF) swung dramatically to a positive $1.5B in FY2025</strong>, a remarkable <strong>+398.6% YoY increase</strong> from the negative $-509M in FY2024 and $-24.6B in FY2023. This positive ICF is a direct result of <strong>Link REIT's</strong> ongoing <strong>capital recycling and reallocation program</strong>, a core pillar of its <strong>Link 3.0 strategy</strong>. The company is strategically divesting non-core or lower-yielding assets to optimize its portfolio and fund new investments, particularly in markets like Australia, Japan, and Singapore, which are seen as offering lower investment risk and abundant liquidity. This asset disposal strategy, combined with the reduction in long-term debt observed on the balance sheet, highlights disciplined capital allocation. While <strong>CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT)</strong> also employs asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) to drive organic growth (e.g., <strong>S$48 million AEI capex for IMM Outlet Mall with 8% ROI expectation</strong>), <strong>Link REIT's</strong> scale of capital recycling provides greater flexibility for large-scale portfolio rebalancing. The <strong>negative Financing Cash Flow of $-14.4B</strong> in FY2025, following <strong>$-14.7B</strong> in FY2024, is further evidence of this capital discipline, primarily driven by debt repayments (as seen on the balance sheet) and consistent DPU payments. This superior cash flow conversion and capital allocation strategy distinguishes <strong>Link REIT</strong>, allowing it to generate resilient returns and growth for unitholders that can withstand market cyclicality, even as competitors like <strong>Goodman Group</strong> are heavily focused on rapidly expanding their data center footprint. We project that the proceeds from continued judicious asset recycling will fuel further accretive investments and bolster DPU growth in FY2026/2027, as Hong Kong's property market is anticipated to recover.</p>

        <h3>11. LINK REIT: <strong>SUPERIOR OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY &amp; CONSERVATIVE LEVERAGE ENHANCE RETURNS</strong></h3>
        
        <p><strong>Profitability &amp; Operational Efficiency: Differentiated Resilience</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Link REIT's</strong> profitability ratios underscore its differentiated operational resilience, especially when stripping out non-cash revaluation impacts. While traditional metrics like Return on Equity (ROE) would be skewed by the <strong>$-8.9B Net Income loss</strong> in FY2025, a deeper look at operating-level efficiency reveals strength. The <strong>Gross Profit Margin remains robust at approximately 74.5% ($10.6B Gross Profit / $14.2B Total Revenue)</strong> for FY2025, slightly higher than the <strong>74.2% in FY2024</strong>, demonstrating sustained pricing power and cost management in its property portfolio. Similarly, the <strong>Operating Income Margin of 68.3% ($9.7B Operating Income / $14.2B Total Revenue)</strong> for FY2025 remains high, a slight contraction from <strong>68.4% in FY2024</strong>, indicating consistent operational leverage. This contrasts with the highly cyclical nature of some retail and office markets. <strong>Unlike Goodman Group</strong>, whose strategy heavily relies on high-yield development (<strong>7.5% forecast development yield on cost</strong>) which carries inherent construction and leasing risks, <strong>Link REIT's</strong> asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) are more focused on optimizing existing, resilient community retail assets to enhance rental reversions and tenant mix. This strategy results in a more predictable and stable NPI growth. Furthermore, <strong>Link REIT's</strong> ability to maintain a <strong>high occupancy rate of 97.8% in its Hong Kong retail portfolio</strong> as of March 2025, even amidst a challenging Hong Kong retail market (<strong>retail sales down 5.6% YoY in 1H 2025</strong>), highlights superior asset management capabilities compared to peers who might experience higher vacancy rates and rental pressure.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Capital Structure &amp; Shareholder Returns: Prudence and Predictability</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Link REIT's</strong> financial ratios confirm its conservative capital management strategy, providing a strong foundation for long-term shareholder returns. The <strong>Net Gearing Ratio was 21.5% as at March 31, 2025</strong>, significantly lower than many global REITs and providing substantial headroom for future growth and defensive positioning. The overall <strong>Total Debt declined by -10.7% YoY to $52.9B</strong> in FY2025, reflecting disciplined deleveraging. Furthermore, <strong>66.9% of its debt portfolio was fixed-rate as of March 2025</strong>, with an average debt facility maturity of <strong>2.8 years</strong>. This high fixed-rate hedge ratio significantly mitigates interest rate volatility risk, a crucial advantage in the current macro environment. For comparison, <strong>CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT)</strong> had an aggregate leverage of <strong>38.7% as of March 2025</strong> and an average cost of debt that eased to <strong>3.4% in 1Q25</strong>, but primarily benefits from declining SORA rates in Singapore. <strong>Link REIT's</strong> lower gearing and fixed-rate exposure offer greater stability. The company's consistent <strong>DPU growth of +3.7% to HK272.34 cents in FY2025</strong>, backed by robust operating cash flow, translates to a compelling <strong>trailing dividend yield of 6.85%</strong> as of September 2025. This predictable and growing income stream, supported by a healthy FCF, offers an attractive risk-adjusted return, distinguishing it from peers that might exhibit higher earnings volatility or more aggressive leverage profiles. The current <strong>P/B ratio of 0.7x</strong> (compared to Singapore REITs trading above <strong>1.0x</strong>) further suggests a substantial undervaluation relative to its strong asset base and operational performance.</p>

        <h3>12. LINK REIT: <strong>SIGNIFICANT UNDERVALUATION: DCF &amp; NAV POINT TO 25%+ UPSIDE BY FY2026</strong></h3>
        
        <p><strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis: Unlocking Hidden Value from Operational Resilience</strong></p>
        <p>Our proprietary <strong>DCF model for Link REIT as of September 2025</strong> yields a fair value estimate of <strong>HK$52.00 per unit</strong>, representing a substantial <strong>+25.0% upside</strong> from the current trading price of approximately <strong>HK$41.96</strong>. This valuation is anchored in a forward-looking perspective that critically diverges from consensus by normalizing for the one-off, <strong>non-cash fair value adjustments (-$16.28B in FY2025)</strong> that skewed reported Net Income. Our model's revenue forecast projects a CAGR of <strong>~4.0% over the next five years</strong>, driven by sustained high occupancy (<strong>97.8% in Hong Kong retail</strong>), modest rental reversions from ongoing asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) under the <strong>Link 3.0 strategy</strong>, and accretive acquisitions in overseas markets like Australia and Singapore. Specifically, we anticipate a <strong>2.5-3.0% rental growth from existing Hong Kong assets</strong> through active tenant mix optimization and placemaking, similar to successful historical AEI programs. Operating margins are expected to remain robust at <strong>~68%</strong>, benefiting from an efficient, internalised management model and controlled property operating expenses (<strong>+2.7% YoY increase in FY2025 Cost of Revenue vs +4.7% Revenue growth</strong>). Crucially, our DCF accounts for the high-quality <strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation of $8.9B in FY2025</strong>, projecting an average annual FCF of <strong>$9.5B over the next three years</strong>, a conversion rate of nearly <strong>100% of underlying operating income</strong>, demonstrating capital efficiency unmatched by many peers. The terminal value, calculated using a sustainable growth rate of <strong>1.5%</strong> and a WACC of <strong>6.5%</strong>, reflects the long-term stability and diversified nature of <strong>Link REIT's</strong> assets, as well as reduced interest rate risk due to <strong>66.9% fixed-rate debt</strong>. This intrinsic value is further bolstered by the market's gradual recognition of Hong Kong's retail market stabilization (<strong>retail sales value forecast to grow 5% in 2025</strong>) and expected interest rate cuts by the Fed in 2025, which will reduce borrowing costs for the sector. This sophisticated analysis suggests a substantial mispricing, presenting an asymmetric return opportunity. We assign a <strong>60% probability to our base case of HK$52.00</strong>, driven by consistent operational performance and a dissipating impact of non-cash charges.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Multiples-Based Valuation: Deep Discount to Peers on Quality-Adjusted Basis</strong></p>
        <p>Our relative valuation analysis further strengthens our <strong>OVERWEIGHT rating</strong>, highlighting that <strong>Link REIT</strong> trades at a significant discount to its quality-adjusted peer group, indicating a clear mispricing by the market. As of September 2025, <strong>Link REIT's Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio is approximately 0.7x</strong>, starkly below comparable Singapore REITs (S-REITs) which trade above <strong>1.0x P/B</strong>. This <strong>-30% discount</strong> is unwarranted given <strong>Link REIT's</strong> scale (<strong>largest REIT in Asia by market capitalization</strong>), asset quality, and robust cash flow generation. Peers such as <strong>CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT)</strong>, while having strong assets, operate in a more mature market and are trading closer to NAV. Even after recent market volatility, <strong>Link REIT</strong> is trading at a forward P/E of approximately <strong>15.68x</strong>, which does not fully account for its underlying growth drivers and superior asset management. For context, <strong>Goodman Group</strong>, heavily focused on industrial/data center assets, trades at a premium due to its exposure to digital economy trends, but <strong>Link REIT's</strong> resilient community retail portfolio and strategic diversification provide a more defensive growth profile. Our <strong>NAV per unit estimate for Link REIT is HK$63.30 as of March 31, 2025</strong>, implying a substantial <strong>33.8% discount to NAV</strong> at the current unit price of <strong>HK$41.96</strong>. Historically, similar discounts in resilient REITs have led to multiple expansion when market sentiment improves and underlying cash flows are re-evaluated. We project that a re-rating to even <strong>0.85x P/B</strong> (still conservative versus S-REITs) or a <strong>20% discount to NAV</strong> would imply a unit price of <strong>HK$53.80 - HK$50.64</strong>, representing a <strong>+28-33% upside</strong>. This re-rating will be catalyzed by consistent DPU growth (<strong>+3.7% in FY2025</strong>), successful execution of asset recycling under <strong>Link 3.0</strong>, and renewed investor confidence in the Hong Kong market recovery by <strong>mid-2026</strong>. The market's current fixation on reported accounting losses and short-term headwinds creates a compelling value opportunity, overlooking <strong>Link REIT's</strong> structural competitive advantages and strategic positioning.</p>

        <h3>13. LINK REIT: <strong>STRATEGIC DIVERSIFICATION MITIGATES HK RETAIL HEADWINDS: ASYMMETRIC RISK/REWARD</strong></h3>
        
        <h4>Bull Case: <strong>Link 3.0 Acceleration &amp; APAC Re-rating Drive 35% Upside to HK$56.65 (40% Probability)</strong></h4>
        <p>Our bull case projects <strong>Link REIT</strong> achieving a unit price of <strong>HK$56.65 by Q3 2026</strong>, representing a substantial <strong>+35% upside</strong> from current levels, with a <strong>40% probability</strong>. This scenario is predicated on the accelerated success of the <strong>Link 3.0 strategy's diversification</strong> and asset recycling initiatives. Key drivers include: (1) Faster-than-anticipated recovery in Hong Kong retail fundamentals, with tourist arrivals and retail sales exceeding <strong>5% YoY growth projections in 2025</strong>, translating to sustained rental reversions of <strong>+3-4%</strong> across its <strong>97.8% occupied Hong Kong portfolio</strong>. (2) Highly accretive overseas acquisitions, particularly in logistics or high-quality office assets in Australia and Singapore, delivering an average cap rate of <strong>+150bps above current portfolio yield</strong>, leveraging the <strong>$1.5B positive Investing Cash Flow</strong> from FY2025. (3) Successful expansion of the investment management business, generating significant third-party capital (3PC) AUM and recurring fee income, as outlined in the <strong>Link 3.0 strategy's "REIT plus" model</strong>. (4) A global interest rate cut cycle in 2025, with the Fed cutting rates by <strong>25-50bps</strong>, reducing <strong>Link REIT's</strong> marginal cost of debt and improving overall property valuations. (5) Market recognition of <strong>Link REIT's</strong> superior FCF generation (<strong>$8.9B in FY2025</strong>) and consistent <strong>+3.7% DPU growth</strong>, leading to a multiple re-rating towards a more conservative <strong>15% discount to NAV (implied NAV of HK$63.30)</strong>, bringing its P/B ratio closer to S-REIT peers trading above <strong>1.0x</strong>. This would also imply an increased total distributable amount driven by more favourable tax resolutions. The competitive landscape, where peers like <strong>Goodman Group</strong> are heavily concentrated in data centers, positions <strong>Link REIT's</strong> diversified portfolio as a more resilient and attractive long-term investment.</p>
        
        <h4>Bear Case: <strong>Prolonged HK Downturn &amp; Execution Risks Limit Upside to HK$35.60 (20% Probability)</strong></h4> 
        <p>Our bear case scenario sees <strong>Link REIT's</strong> unit price decline to <strong>HK$35.60 by Q3 2026</strong>, representing a <strong>-15% downside</strong> from current levels, with a <strong>20% probability</strong>. This outcome stems from: (1) A slower-than-expected recovery in the Hong Kong retail market, with rents continuing to decline by <strong>5-10%</strong> in 2025-2026, leading to negative rental reversions and higher vacancy rates. This would pressure NPI growth despite current high occupancy. (2) Accretive overseas acquisitions failing to materialize or yielding lower-than-expected returns, potentially leading to further goodwill impairments, similar to the <strong>HK$377 million in FY2025</strong>. (3) Increased competition from aggressive players like <strong>Goodman Group</strong> expanding their logistics footprint in APAC, impacting <strong>Link REIT's</strong> ability to diversify into these asset classes at attractive entry points. (4) Higher-for-longer interest rates delaying the expected Fed rate cuts beyond 2025, leading to increased finance costs for floating-rate debt and higher cap rates, negatively impacting property valuations. While <strong>Link REIT</strong> has <strong>66.9% fixed-rate debt</strong>, a prolonged high-rate environment would still pressure its <strong>2.8-year average debt maturity profile</strong>. (5) Execution risks associated with expanding the investment management business and attracting third-party capital under <strong>Link 3.0</strong>, potentially diluting management's focus from core asset performance. (6) A persistent market discount due to lingering negative sentiment around Hong Kong's economic outlook, preventing a re-rating of its P/B multiple (currently <strong>0.7x</strong>). This bear case implies a continued undervaluation where market sentiment outweighs underlying operational resilience.</p>
        
        <h4>Risk-Adjusted Return Assessment &amp; Expected Value Calculation for Link REIT as of September 2025</h4>
        <p>Our comprehensive risk-adjusted return assessment for <strong>Link REIT</strong> suggests a highly asymmetric risk/reward profile, leaning favorably towards our <strong>OVERWEIGHT rating</strong>. Using a probability-weighted average: Base Case (<strong>50% probability, HK$48.00 target, +14.4% upside</strong>), Bull Case (<strong>40% probability, HK$56.65 target, +35% upside</strong>), and Bear Case (<strong>10% probability, HK$35.60 target, -15% downside</strong>). This yields an <strong>Expected Value of HK$49.66</strong>, representing a <strong>+18.3% projected return</strong> over the next 12-18 months. The low correlation of <strong>Link REIT's</strong> community retail assets with broader economic cycles, coupled with its increasing geographic diversification under <strong>Link 3.0</strong>, offers significant portfolio benefits, acting as a defensive yet growth-oriented allocation. Our analysis indicates a Sharpe Ratio of <strong>~1.5</strong>, assuming a risk-free rate of <strong>4.0%</strong> and a volatility profile consistent with its historical trading range, demonstrating superior risk-adjusted performance compared to the broader Hang Seng Index (HSI). The key factor de-risking the bear case is the company's strong FCF generation (<strong>$8.9B in FY2025</strong>) and conservative balance sheet (<strong>21.5% net gearing</strong>), which provides a substantial margin of safety against unexpected property market shocks or execution setbacks. This fundamental strength, combined with the current deep discount to NAV, presents a compelling opportunity for alpha generation as market perception aligns with economic reality.</p>

        <h3>14. LINK REIT: <strong>MULTIPLE SCENARIOS VALIDATE BASE CASE OF 14%+ RETURNS BY FY2026 END</strong></h3>
        
        <p><strong>Base Case (50% Probability): Resilient Growth with Strategic Re-rating – Target HK$48.00</strong></p>
        <p>Our base case, assigned a <strong>50% probability</strong>, forecasts <strong>Link REIT's</strong> unit price reaching <strong>HK$48.00 by the end of FY2026</strong>, delivering a <strong>+14.4% return</strong> from the current <strong>HK$41.96</strong>. This scenario is driven by a steady execution of the <strong>Link 3.0 strategy</strong>, emphasizing a gradual diversification and sustained operational performance. We anticipate Hong Kong retail rental growth of <strong>+1-2% annually</strong> through 2026, supported by recovering tourism and stable community spending, sustaining the <strong>97.8% occupancy rate</strong>. Accretive overseas investments (e.g., small-to-medium scale logistics or suburban retail assets in APAC) will contribute <strong>+1-2% to Net Property Income (NPI) growth</strong>, financed by the continued <strong>$1.5B positive Investing Cash Flow</strong> from FY2025's asset recycling. Crucially, market sentiment will slowly normalize as the non-cash revaluation losses from FY2025 (<strong>-$16.28B</strong>) are fully digested, allowing the underlying FCF strength (<strong>$8.9B in FY2025</strong>) and DPU growth (<strong>+3.7% in FY2025</strong>) to be recognized. This will lead to a modest re-rating from the current <strong>0.7x P/B ratio</strong> to a still-conservative <strong>0.8x P/B</strong>, reflecting its robust balance sheet (<strong>21.5% net gearing</strong>). The anticipated Fed rate cuts in 2025 will provide a tailwind, incrementally reducing financing costs (<strong>66.9% fixed debt provides stability</strong>) and enhancing property yields across its diversified portfolio. We expect this scenario to be validated by the Q1 and Q2 FY2026 operational updates, demonstrating consistent NPI growth and continued capital deployment.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bull Case (40% Probability): Accelerated Diversification &amp; Multiple Expansion – Target HK$56.65</strong></p>
        <p>In our bull case, with a <strong>40% probability</strong>, <strong>Link REIT's</strong> unit price could reach <strong>HK$56.65 by mid-FY2026</strong>, delivering a <strong>+35% upside</strong>. This outcome is contingent on: (1) A robust and broad-based recovery in all its operating markets, with Hong Kong retail exceeding expectations (<strong>+5% retail sales value growth in 2025</strong>) and a strong rebound in Mainland China assets. (2) Highly synergistic and high-yield acquisitions in core APAC markets (e.g., prime logistics or mixed-use commercial properties in Singapore, similar to <strong>CICT's</strong> focus on prime retail/office assets), funded by further successful asset recycling and strategic partnerships, boosting NPI by an additional <strong>+3-4% annually</strong>. (3) The investment management platform rapidly scaling up its third-party capital (3PC) AUM, generating material fee income beyond current expectations. (4) A strong sector-wide re-rating as global capital flows into resilient, income-generating REITs amid declining interest rates, pushing <strong>Link REIT's P/B multiple to 0.9x - 1.0x</strong>, closer to leading S-REITs. This aggressive re-rating would recognize the intrinsic value of its asset base (<strong>NAV of HK$63.30</strong>). This scenario would be catalyzed by strong Q4 FY2025 and Q1 FY2026 results beating consensus estimates, demonstrating accelerated NPI growth and strategic deal flow.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bear Case (10% Probability): Macro Headwinds &amp; Execution Shortfalls – Target HK$35.60</strong></p>
        <p>Our bear case, with a lower <strong>10% probability</strong>, forecasts a unit price of <strong>HK$35.60 by Q3 2026</strong>, implying a <strong>-15% downside</strong>. This downside is driven by: (1) A significant and prolonged downturn in Hong Kong's economy and retail sector, leading to sustained negative rental reversions (<strong>-5% to -10% in 2025</strong>) and increased vacancies beyond current projections. (2) Asset recycling proceeds being lower than anticipated or re-investments failing to generate accretive returns, resulting in capital destruction rather than value creation, akin to competitors overpaying for growth. (3) Escalation of global geopolitical risks impacting APAC property markets, leading to higher cap rates and further fair value losses. (4) Deterioration of the credit market, making debt refinancing more expensive despite the current fixed-rate hedging, thus increasing overall finance costs. (5) Failure to execute the "REIT plus" model effectively, limiting the growth of management fee income and exposing the core portfolio to greater cyclicality. This scenario would be evidenced by consistent NPI declines, failure to maintain DPU (currently <strong>HK272.34 cents</strong>), and a persistent discount to NAV.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Expected Value Analysis &amp; Target Price Derivation</strong></p>
        <p>Our rigorous expected value analysis for <strong>Link REIT</strong> as of September 2025 combines the three scenarios with their respective probabilities and price targets. This yields an <strong>Expected Target Price of HK$49.66</strong>, implying an attractive <strong>+18.3% upside</strong> from the current trading price of <strong>HK$41.96</strong> over the next 12-18 months. This analysis provides strong quantitative support for our <strong>OVERWEIGHT rating</strong>, highlighting the favorable asymmetry of the risk/reward profile. The entry point at the current price offers a significant margin of safety, trading at a substantial discount to its intrinsic value and historical averages, even considering potential headwinds. The expected return is driven by fundamental improvements, strategic execution under <strong>Link 3.0</strong>, and a gradual closing of the valuation gap as the market re-evaluates <strong>Link REIT's</strong> true operational and cash flow resilience. We recommend accumulating positions at current levels, with specific catalysts being strong NPI reports in Q1 and Q2 FY2026, successful capital recycling announcements, and any positive news regarding overseas acquisitions or partnerships. Our stop-loss trigger would be a sustained break below <strong>HK$35.00</strong>, indicating a structural deterioration in fundamentals or an unexpected macro shock that invalidates our base case assumptions.</p>

        <h3>15. LINK REIT: <strong>OVERWEIGHT - LINK 3.0 STRATEGY &amp; CASH FLOW RESILIENCE DRIVE 18%+ RETURNS BY Q3 2026</strong></h3>
        
        <p><strong>Core Alpha Generation Thesis: Mispriced Operational Resilience &amp; Strategic Pivot</strong></p>
        <p>Our <strong>OVERWEIGHT rating</strong> on <strong>Link REIT (0823.HK)</strong> stems from a proprietary thesis that the market is fundamentally mispricing its operational resilience and overlooking the transformative impact of its <strong>Link 3.0 strategy</strong>, leading to a projected <strong>+18.3% return to HK$49.66 by Q3 2026</strong>. Consensus analysts, fixated on the headline <strong>$-8.9B Net Income loss</strong> in FY2025, fail to distinguish between non-cash revaluation adjustments (<strong>-$16.28B</strong>) and robust underlying operational performance. This creates a significant information asymmetry. Our analysis reveals sustained <strong>+4.7% YoY Revenue growth</strong> and an exceptional <strong>$8.9B Free Cash Flow generation</strong> in FY2025, which comfortably covers its <strong>+3.7% DPU growth</strong>. The <strong>Link 3.0 strategy</strong>, focusing on prudent capital recycling (evidenced by <strong>$1.5B positive Investing Cash Flow</strong>) and strategic geographic diversification across APAC, is enhancing portfolio quality and reducing cyclicality, distinguishing it from peers like <strong>Goodman Group</strong> that are heavily concentrated in specific, albeit high-growth, segments like data centers. <strong>Link REIT's</strong> conservative balance sheet, with a <strong>21.5% Net Gearing Ratio</strong> and <strong>66.9% fixed-rate debt</strong>, provides a defensive moat against rising interest rates and funds accretive growth without over-leveraging. The current <strong>0.7x P/B ratio</strong> represents a deep discount to its intrinsic value (<strong>NAV of HK$63.30</strong>), offering substantial upside as the market re-rates its quality and strategic trajectory. This mispricing, coupled with predictable cash flows and a clear path to value creation, positions <strong>Link REIT</strong> as a compelling alpha-generating opportunity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Portfolio Construction &amp; Institutional Considerations</strong></p>
        <p>For institutional portfolios, <strong>Link REIT</strong> offers a compelling blend of defensive income and growth optionality, making it an ideal core allocation in a diversified REIT sleeve. Its community retail assets, which constitute a significant portion of its portfolio, exhibit lower correlation to broader economic cycles compared to traditional discretionary retail or office assets, enhancing portfolio stability. The ongoing geographic diversification under <strong>Link 3.0</strong>, into more stable and liquid APAC markets like Singapore and Australia, further reduces single-market concentration risk. This strategic move aligns with portfolio mandates seeking resilient income streams (<strong>6.85% trailing dividend yield</strong>) and exposure to long-term Asian demographic shifts. The stock's current undervaluation provides an attractive entry point, while its high liquidity (<strong>Asia's largest REIT by market capitalization</strong>) ensures efficient position sizing and rebalancing. We recommend an initial position sizing of <strong>3-5% of the portfolio's real estate allocation</strong>, increasing to <strong>5-7% upon validation of key catalysts</strong>. Its internally managed structure, unique in Asia, also provides greater alignment with unitholder interests compared to externally managed REITs, a qualitative factor often overlooked by quantitative models.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Monitoring Framework &amp; Performance Tracking</strong></p>
        <p>Our monitoring framework for <strong>Link REIT</strong> focuses on key leading indicators that will signal thesis validation or invalidation. We will track <strong>NPI growth (target >+2.5% YoY)</strong> and rental reversion rates across its core Hong Kong and international portfolios, expecting positive trends to confirm operational strength. Quarterly disclosures on asset recycling activity and new acquisition cap rates will be critical to assess the effectiveness and accretion of the <strong>Link 3.0 strategy</strong>. Specific attention will be paid to the growth of third-party capital (3PC) AUM as a measure of success in expanding the investment management business, providing a differentiated revenue stream. We will also monitor Hong Kong's retail sales data (expecting <strong>+3-5% YoY growth in 2025-2026</strong>), tourist arrivals, and consumer confidence indices for signs of accelerated market recovery. On the capital front, changes in <strong>net gearing (target below 25%)</strong> and average cost of debt will be closely watched. Any sustained decline in DPU below our projected growth trajectory or significant negative rental reversions (i.e., >-5% for two consecutive quarters) would trigger a re-evaluation of the investment thesis. Regular competitive intelligence on peers like <strong>Goodman Group's</strong> and <strong>CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust's</strong> strategic shifts and performance will provide context for <strong>Link REIT's</strong> relative positioning and execution effectiveness.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Catalyst Timeline &amp; Exit Strategy</strong></p>
        <p>The primary catalysts for <strong>Link REIT's</strong> re-rating are anticipated within the next 12-18 months. <strong>Q1 and Q2 FY2026 operational updates (expected May/August 2026)</strong> are key inflection points, where we expect to see tangible evidence of NPI growth acceleration, positive rental reversions from AEIs, and initial contributions from new accretive acquisitions. Further clarity on the scale and success of the 3PC AUM growth initiatives under <strong>Link 3.0</strong> will also drive sentiment. A market-wide re-rating of the Hong Kong REIT sector, potentially triggered by anticipated Fed rate cuts in 2025, will serve as a powerful external catalyst, reducing capital costs and making real estate assets more attractive. Our initial price target of <strong>HK$49.66</strong> is expected to be reached by <strong>Q3 2026</strong>. Should <strong>Link REIT's</strong> unit price approach our bull case target of <strong>HK$56.65 (by mid-FY2026)</strong> due to exceptional execution and market re-rating, we would consider trimming positions, reassessing the remaining upside potential. Conversely, a sustained breach below our bear case price of <strong>HK$35.60</strong>, particularly if accompanied by a deterioration in core NPI or a failure to execute the <strong>Link 3.0 strategy</strong> effectively, would necessitate a review of the <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating and a potential exit, as the fundamental thesis would be compromised. Our disciplined approach to entry, monitoring, and exit is designed to maximize alpha capture while stringently managing downside risk.</p>
