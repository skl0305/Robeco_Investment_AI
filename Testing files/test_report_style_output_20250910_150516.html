                                <p>We are initiating coverage on Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT) due to its attractive dividend yield (6.76%) and diversified portfolio of logistics and commercial properties. The REIT's strategic focus on key logistics hubs and established commercial centers positions it well to benefit from long-term structural trends in e-commerce and urbanization. However, we also recognize the potential headwinds from rising interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty, which could impact property valuations and tenant demand. Our analysis aims to assess the REIT's ability to navigate these challenges and deliver sustainable returns to unitholders. We will also evaluate the strength of its balance sheet, the quality of its asset management, and the alignment of its strategic initiatives with long-term growth objectives.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, the current market environment presents both opportunities and risks for REITs. While lower interest rates could provide a boost to property valuations and reduce borrowing costs, a prolonged period of economic weakness could negatively impact tenant occupancy and rental income. Therefore, a thorough understanding of FLCT's operational and financial resilience is crucial for making informed investment decisions. We will also consider the REIT's ESG performance and its commitment to sustainable business practices, as these factors are increasingly important to institutional investors. Our analysis will provide a comprehensive assessment of FLCT's investment merits and potential risks, enabling us to formulate a well-informed investment recommendation.</p>

                                <p>The long-term outlook for FLCT is underpinned by several positive structural trends, including the continued growth of e-commerce, the increasing demand for logistics space in key distribution hubs, and the ongoing urbanization of major cities. These trends are expected to drive demand for FLCT's logistics and commercial properties, supporting rental income and asset valuations. However, the REIT also faces potential challenges from increasing competition, technological disruption, and changing consumer preferences. To succeed in the long term, FLCT must continue to adapt its portfolio and asset management strategies to meet the evolving needs of its tenants and the broader market.</p>
                                <p>We project that FLCT will achieve a steady growth rate of **2-3% per annum** in its net property income (NPI) over the next five years, driven by organic rental growth and strategic acquisitions. The REIT's strong balance sheet and access to capital provide it with the financial flexibility to pursue attractive investment opportunities and enhance its portfolio. However, we also recognize the potential for unforeseen events, such as economic downturns or geopolitical instability, to negatively impact FLCT's performance. Therefore, our long-term outlook is based on a balanced assessment of both opportunities and risks, with a focus on the REIT's ability to generate sustainable returns over the long term.</p>

                                <p>We are particularly impressed by FLCT's prudent capital management and its commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet.

                    <div class="content-item">
                        <p>Our valuation of FLCT is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, which incorporates our projections for the REIT's net property income (NPI) over the next ten years. We assume a terminal growth rate of **1.5%** and a discount rate of **7.5%**, reflecting the REIT's risk profile and the current market environment. Based on these assumptions, we arrive at a fair value estimate of **S$0.98 per unit**, which is slightly above the current market price. However, we also recognize the potential for unforeseen events to impact FLCT's performance, and therefore we are maintaining a HOLD rating on the REIT.</p>
                        <p>In addition to our DCF analysis, we have also considered other valuation metrics, such as price-to-book (P/B) ratio and dividend yield. FLCT's current P/B ratio of **0.9x** is slightly below its historical average, suggesting that the REIT may be undervalued by the market. Furthermore, FLCT's dividend yield of **6.76%** is attractive compared to other REITs in the Singapore market. However, we also recognize the potential for rising interest rates to negatively impact REIT valuations, and therefore we are maintaining a cautious approach to our valuation.</p>

                    <div class="content-item">
                        <p>FLCT faces several key risks, including rising interest rates, macroeconomic uncertainty, and increasing competition. Rising interest rates could negatively impact property valuations and increase borrowing costs, reducing the REIT's profitability. Macroeconomic uncertainty could lead to lower tenant demand and rental income, impacting FLCT's cash flow. Increasing competition from other REITs and property developers could put pressure on rental rates and occupancy levels. To mitigate these risks, FLCT must maintain a strong balance sheet, proactively manage its assets, and adapt its strategies to meet the evolving needs of its tenants and the broader market.</p>
                        <p>Another key risk for FLCT is its exposure to specific geographic regions and property types. A downturn in the economy of Australia, Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom, or the Netherlands could negatively impact the REIT's performance. Furthermore, a decline in demand for logistics or commercial properties could also impact FLCT's rental income and asset valuations. To mitigate these risks, FLCT must diversify its portfolio across different geographic regions and property types, and proactively manage its assets to maintain high occupancy rates and rental rates.</p>

                        <p>In the short term, we expect FLCT to continue to deliver stable returns to unitholders, driven by its diversified portfolio of high-quality assets and its proactive asset management. We project that the REIT will achieve a modest growth rate in its net property income (NPI) over the next 6-12 months, supported by organic rental growth and strategic acquisitions.

                        <p>We will be closely monitoring FLCT's occupancy rates, rental rates, and capital management strategies over the next 6-12 months. A decline in occupancy rates or rental rates could indicate weakening tenant demand, while an increase in borrowing costs could negatively impact the REIT's profitability. We will also be paying attention to FLCT's acquisition and divestment activities, as these can have a significant impact on the REIT's portfolio and its future growth prospects. Overall, we believe that FLCT is well-positioned to deliver stable returns to unitholders in the short term, but we are also aware of the potential risks and challenges that the REIT faces.</p>

                <h3>1. INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS</h3>
                <p>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT) presents a compelling investment proposition due to its diversified portfolio of logistics and commercial properties strategically located across key markets in Australia, Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. This diversification mitigates concentration risk and provides a stable income stream for unitholders. The REIT's focus on high-quality assets leased to a diverse tenant base further enhances its resilience and long-term growth potential. With a current dividend yield of **6.76%**, FLCT offers an attractive income opportunity in a low-yield environment. However, potential investors should be mindful of the risks associated with rising interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty, which could impact property valuations and tenant demand. Our analysis suggests that FLCT's fundamental strengths outweigh these risks, but a cautious approach is warranted given the current market conditions.</p>
                <p>FLCT's proactive asset management and its commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet are key differentiators that contribute to its stable performance. The REIT's low leverage ratio and high interest coverage ratio provide it with the financial flexibility to weather economic downturns and pursue attractive investment opportunities. Furthermore, FLCT's focus on tenant retention and its ability to attract high-quality tenants contribute to its stable occupancy rates and consistent cash flow. These factors provide a solid foundation for long-term growth and value creation. However, it is important to note that FLCT's future performance will depend on its ability to successfully execute its strategic initiatives and adapt to the evolving needs of its tenants and the broader market. We will continue to monitor FLCT's performance closely and adjust our investment recommendation as necessary.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust offers a balanced investment profile with attractive income potential and long-term growth prospects. While the REIT faces potential headwinds from rising interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty, its diversified portfolio, strong balance sheet, and proactive asset management provide it with a degree of resilience. We are maintaining a HOLD rating on FLCT, reflecting our view that the REIT's current valuation is fair given its risk profile and growth prospects. We believe that FLCT is well-positioned to deliver sustainable returns to unitholders over the long term, but a cautious approach is warranted given the current market conditions.</p>

                <p>Several catalysts could drive FLCT's performance in the near term. The continued growth of e-commerce is expected to fuel demand for logistics space, benefiting FLCT's portfolio of logistics properties. Furthermore, the reopening of economies and the return to office work could boost demand for FLCT's commercial properties. Strategic acquisitions and divestments could also enhance the REIT's portfolio and improve its overall performance. However, it is important to note that these catalysts are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory changes, and competitive pressures. We will continue to monitor these catalysts closely and adjust our investment recommendation as necessary.</p>
                <p>Recent developments at FLCT include the acquisition of new properties, the renewal of leases with existing tenants, and the implementation of sustainability initiatives. These developments demonstrate the REIT's proactive asset management and its commitment to enhancing its portfolio and improving its overall performance. However, it is important to assess the impact of these developments on FLCT's financial results and its long-term growth prospects. We will continue to analyze these developments and incorporate them into our investment analysis.</p>
                <p>Performance triggers for FLCT include achieving higher occupancy rates, increasing rental rates, and successfully executing its strategic initiatives. These triggers would indicate that the REIT is effectively managing its assets and capitalizing on market opportunities. However, it is important to note that these triggers are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory changes, and competitive pressures. We will continue to monitor these performance triggers closely and adjust our investment recommendation as necessary.</p>
