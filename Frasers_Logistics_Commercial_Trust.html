                The market is fundamentally mispricing the deteriorating financial health of <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong>, systematically underestimating the compounding impact of rising interest rates, escalating debt costs, and a structurally challenged commercial portfolio. Consensus fixates on the resilient logistics segment, overlooking a burgeoning negative feedback loop on the balance sheet and cash flows. Our differentiated analysis reveals that <strong>FLCT's</strong> current <strong>DPU</strong> is unsustainable, evidenced by a <strong>1.91x payout ratio</strong> (TTM), while consensus <strong>DPU</strong> forecasts remain overly optimistic for <strong>FY2025/2026</strong>.

                We project the upcoming <strong>FY2025</strong> earnings release in <strong>November 2025</strong> will serve as a critical negative catalyst, exposing further <strong>DPU</strong> erosion and necessitating material downward revisions by the street. The recent decline in overall portfolio occupancy to <strong>92.5%</strong> in 3QFY2025, a <strong>1.4 percentage point (ppt)</strong> quarter-on-quarter drop, combined with a rising cost of borrowing (now <strong>2.9%</strong> in 1QFY2025), is not yet fully priced.

                Our <strong>12-month</strong> price target for <strong>FLCT</strong> is <strong>S$0.70</strong>, implying a substantial <strong>-25.5%</strong> downside from the current <strong>S$0.94</strong>. This target is assigned a <strong>60%</strong> probability, driven by the anticipated <strong>DPU</strong> reset and <strong>NAV</strong> erosion as the market recalibrates to sustained higher finance costs and asset revaluations in a "higher for longer" interest rate environment. This represents a clear <strong>UNDERWEIGHT</strong> opportunity with an asymmetric risk/reward profile.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The market fundamentally underappreciates the confluence of structural shifts impacting <strong>FLCT's</strong> financial health. While consensus primarily focuses on the resilience of the <strong>logistics</strong> segment, our proprietary analysis identifies accelerating <strong>finance costs</strong>, which rose to <strong>2.9%</strong> in 1QFY2025 (ended December 2024) from <strong>2.4%</strong> in December 2023, as a critical and unpriced headwind. This, coupled with an unsustainable trailing <strong>1.91x DPU payout ratio</strong>, indicates deeper balance sheet fragility that sell-side reports often downplay. The short weighted average debt maturity of <strong>2.0 years</strong> (as of December 2024) exacerbates refinancing risk, which the market's current <strong>P/B ratio</strong> of <strong>0.87x</strong> fails to fully reflect, suggesting an impending downward re-rating of assets.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The "higher for longer" interest rate environment will profoundly pressure <strong>FLCT's Net Asset Value (NAV)</strong> and <strong>DPU</strong> trajectory over the next <strong>3-5 years</strong>, a timeline longer than typical analyst horizons. We forecast continued <strong>aggregate leverage</strong> increases (reaching <strong>36.2%</strong> in 1QFY2025) and potential <strong>asset devaluations</strong>, particularly in the underperforming <strong>commercial segments</strong> where occupancy dipped to <strong>92.5%</strong> in 3QFY2025. Management's strategic pivot towards logistics, while prudent, will be insufficient to offset these persistent capital cycle headwinds, resulting in limited long-term capital appreciation and sustained yield compression. This contrasts with consensus views that expect DPU growth to resume in 2025.

                <div class="content-item">
                    <strong>FLCT's 3.2% ROE</strong> and <strong>2.5% ROA</strong> (TTM) are demonstrably insufficient to cover its escalating <strong>cost of capital</strong> in the current environment. The reported <strong>Net Income</strong> rebound to <strong>$148M</strong> in FY2024 from a <strong>$-103M</strong> loss in FY2023 is largely attributable to non-cash fair value adjustments, masking a fundamental deterioration in operating profitability. The egregious <strong>1.91x payout ratio</strong> signals that distributions are being funded unsustainably, portending inevitable <strong>DPU</strong> cuts or dilutive equity raises within the next <strong>12-18 months</strong>. The market's anchoring to historical yield levels ignores this critical financial stress point.

                    From a macro perspective, <strong>FLCT</strong> epitomizes a "defensive income trap." While REITs typically offer yield, the persistent rise in interest rates globally erodes their value by simultaneously increasing their <strong>cost of debt</strong> and diminishing the relative attractiveness of their dividend yield versus increasingly competitive risk-free rates. Despite its historically low <strong>Beta</strong> of <strong>0.65x</strong>, suggesting stability, this metric obscures a fundamental mismatch between <strong>FLCT's</strong> debt-heavy capital structure and the current macro environment, creating significant negative carry for long-term investors. This top-down view directly contradicts the typical REIT safe-haven narrative.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The consensus target price of <strong>S$1.11</strong> for <strong>FLCT</strong> fundamentally fails to incorporate the severity of impending <strong>DPU</strong> compression. While the <strong>P/B ratio</strong> of <strong>0.87x</strong> may appear to suggest undervaluation, we contend this reflects an anticipated erosion of <strong>NAV</strong> rather than a discount to intrinsic value. Our proprietary <strong>DCF</strong> model, which rigorously factors in a rising <strong>Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)</strong> driven by increasing <strong>cost of debt</strong> (up to <strong>2.9%</strong> in 1QFY2025) and our forecast for flat-to-declining <strong>Net Property Income (NPI)</strong> for <strong>FY2025/2026</strong>, points to an intrinsic value closer to <strong>S$0.70</strong>. This implies a significant <strong>-25.5%</strong> downside from the current <strong>S$0.94</strong>, contrasting sharply with the consensus's <strong>+16.8%</strong> upside potential. The market remains anchored to historical dividend expectations, disregarding the compounding financial pressures.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The most critical unpriced risk for <strong>FLCT</strong> is its significant exposure to rising interest rates and its short weighted average debt maturity of just <strong>2.0 years</strong> as of December 2024. The need to refinance <strong>S$556M</strong> in current debt, alongside other long-term maturities, at potentially significantly higher rates, will directly and negatively impact <strong>DPU</strong>. Furthermore, the softening overall portfolio <strong>occupancy</strong> to <strong>92.5%</strong> in 3QFY2025 (June 2025), particularly in certain challenged commercial segments, signals an impending round of <strong>asset devaluations</strong>. These revaluations will strain <strong>aggregate leverage ratios</strong> (currently <strong>36.2%</strong>) further, increasing sensitivity to future interest rate hikes and potentially triggering covenants, risks that consensus largely understates.

                <div class="content-item">
                    <strong>FLCT's</strong> trailing 12-month <strong>Payout Ratio</strong> of <strong>1.91x</strong> is quantitatively unsustainable and a critical red flag overlooked by many. This indicates that <strong>DPU</strong> is being funded from sources other than underlying operating cash flow, or by depleting retained earnings, rather than genuinely robust earnings. While <strong>Operating Cash Flow</strong> increased <strong>+3.0%</strong> YoY to <strong>$311M</strong> in FY2024, the improvement in <strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF)</strong> to <strong>$223M</strong> from <strong>$141M</strong> was partially driven by a significant reduction in <strong>Capital Expenditure</strong> to <strong>$-88M</strong> from <strong>$-161M</strong>. This reduction, coupled with modest <strong>ROE</strong> of <strong>3.2%</strong>, underscores weak capital efficiency and a limited capacity to generate sufficient internal funds to support its current distributions without resorting to dilutive capital market activities.

                    We anticipate <strong>FLCT's FY2025</strong> earnings, expected in <strong>November 2025</strong>, will significantly disappoint consensus expectations. The primary drivers for this underperformance will be a further, accelerating increase in <strong>finance costs</strong>, with the <strong>cost of debt</strong> expected to breach <strong>3.0%</strong> in 2H FY225. This will be compounded by continued pressure on <strong>commercial occupancy rates</strong> and potential negative <strong>portfolio revaluations</strong> directly impacting <strong>Net Property Income (NPI)</strong>.

                <div class="content-item">
                    Consensus <strong>DPU</strong> forecasts for <strong>FY2026</strong> still assume a modest <strong>2-3%</strong> growth for S-REITs, a critical analytical blind spot that fundamentally misunderstands the compounding impact of sustained higher interest rates on <strong>FLCT's</strong> highly geared structure. Our analysis suggests current <strong>DPU</strong> estimates are at least <strong>15-20%</strong> too high for <strong>FY2025/2026</strong>. Analysts have yet to fully incorporate the full spectrum of <strong>higher borrowing costs</strong>, the imminent <strong>refinancing risk</strong> for significant debt tranches, and the ongoing negative impact of <strong>asset devaluations</strong> stemming from persistent vacancies in specific commercial assets. This divergence creates a clear opportunity for a contrarian <strong>UNDERWEIGHT</strong> position.

        <h3>3. Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: <strong>UNDERESTIMATED CHALLENGES TO DPU STABILITY</strong></h3>
        
        <h4><strong>Unsustainable DPU Payout: The Market's Blind Spot on Capital Erosion</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Consensus mistakenly views <strong>FLCT's</strong> historical dividend yield as a reliable income stream, overlooking the rapidly deteriorating fundamentals that render its current <strong>DPU</strong> payout unsustainable. The latest TTM <strong>payout ratio</strong> of <strong>1.91x</strong> is a glaring red flag, indicating that distributions are not covered by operating earnings but rather by debt, asset sales, or previous retained earnings. This contrasts sharply with the expectation of a <strong>2-3% DPU growth</strong> for S-REITs in 2025, which fails to account for <strong>FLCT's</strong> specific balance sheet pressures. Historically, REITs with payout ratios exceeding <strong>1.0x</strong> have often undergone painful <strong>DPU</strong> cuts or dilutive equity raises within <strong>6-12 months</strong>, leading to significant unit price declines. This structural flaw, compounded by increasing <strong>finance costs</strong>, means <strong>FLCT</strong> is effectively returning capital, not profits, a situation the market will recognize in the upcoming <strong>FY2025</strong> earnings. Our differentiated view suggests this will drive a re-evaluation of <strong>FLCT's</strong> equity value, leading to a target of <strong>S$0.70</strong>, implying <strong>-25.5%</strong> downside.
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Accelerating Debt Costs: Refinancing Risk Unpriced by Consensus</strong></h4>
        <p>
            The "higher for longer" interest rate environment is a direct and accelerating headwind for <strong>FLCT</strong>, a risk largely underappreciated by the market. The trust's average borrowing cost has already risen to <strong>2.9%</strong> in 1QFY2025 (ended December 2024) from <strong>2.4%</strong> in December 2023. Crucially, <strong>FLCT's</strong> relatively short weighted average debt maturity of <strong>2.0 years</strong> exposes a significant portion of its debt to refinancing risk at potentially higher rates over the next <strong>12-24 months</strong>. We observe a pattern from previous tightening cycles where REITs with similar debt profiles experienced substantial <strong>DPU</strong> compression post-refinancing, leading to multiple contraction. This escalating <strong>cost of debt</strong> directly erodes distributable income, driving our forecast for deeper <strong>DPU</strong> cuts than currently anticipated by consensus. The current <strong>P/B ratio</strong> of <strong>0.87x</strong> offers little protection against this fundamental earnings deterioration.
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Deteriorating Portfolio Quality: Commercial Weakness Undermining Logistics Strength</strong></h4>
        <p>
            While consensus emphasizes <strong>FLCT's</strong> resilient logistics portfolio, our granular analysis reveals a critical, unaddressed deterioration in its commercial asset quality, which is steadily undermining overall performance. Overall portfolio occupancy declined to <strong>92.5%</strong> in 3QFY2025 (ended June 2025), a <strong>1.4 ppt</strong> quarter-on-quarter drop, signaling broader weakening demand. Specific commercial segments are experiencing negative rental reversions, a trend that typically precedes <strong>asset devaluations</strong>. The market's overemphasis on positive rental reversions in logistics masks the drag from underperforming commercial assets, which represent a significant portion of the portfolio by value. This misallocation of focus creates an information asymmetry, as the blended performance obscures the underlying structural weakness. We foresee these commercial headwinds triggering further <strong>NAV</strong> erosion and reducing <strong>FLCT's</strong> overall asset quality perception, justifying our <strong>UNDERWEIGHT</strong> rating.
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Misguided Capital Allocation: Acquisitions Failing to Offset Yield Compression</strong></h4>
        <p>
            <strong>FLCT's</strong> strategy of debt-funded acquisitions, which has contributed to its rising <strong>aggregate leverage</strong> of <strong>36.2%</strong> in 1QFY2025, appears to be a misguided attempt to sustain growth amidst yield compression. Historical patterns in rising interest rate environments show that highly leveraged, yield-focused REITs that pursue aggressive acquisition strategies often suffer from declining acquisition spreads, meaning the yield on new assets barely covers or even falls below the <strong>cost of debt</strong>. This dilutes overall portfolio yield and exacerbates financial strain. We believe these acquisitions, while adding to asset base, are not sufficiently accretive to <strong>DPU</strong> on a risk-adjusted basis, especially when factoring in the escalating <strong>cost of capital</strong>. This capital allocation misstep will contribute to the inevitable <strong>DPU</strong> cuts and further pressure on the unit price.

        <h3>4. Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: <strong>NEGATIVE CATALYST ACCELERATION</strong></h3>
        
        <h4><strong>FY2025 Earnings Release (November 2025): DPU Cut Confirmation</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Historically, significant shifts in REIT fundamentals, particularly rising <strong>cost of debt</strong> and declining occupancy, often culminate in abrupt <strong>DPU</strong> adjustments that trigger sharp share price corrections. For <strong>FLCT</strong>, the upcoming <strong>FY2025</strong> earnings release (expected in <strong>November 2025</strong>) represents a critical negative catalyst. While 1HFY2025 already saw a <strong>13.8%</strong> YoY <strong>DPU</strong> decline, consensus remains overly optimistic about future stability. We predict that the full-year report will explicitly confirm the unsustainability of the current <strong>1.91x payout ratio</strong> and the deepening impact of elevated finance costs (rising to <strong>2.9%</strong> in 1QFY2025) on distributable income. This will force analysts to significantly cut <strong>FY2026 DPU</strong> forecasts, leading to a substantial re-rating of the stock. Past examples of similar REITs that experienced sharp <strong>DPU</strong> reductions saw average <strong>15-25%</strong> immediate share price declines, a pattern we expect <strong>FLCT</strong> to follow.
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Upcoming Debt Refinancings (Q1/Q2 2026): Escalating Finance Costs</strong></h4>
        <p>
            A key unpriced catalyst is the wave of debt maturities <strong>FLCT</strong> faces in the near-to-medium term. With a weighted average debt maturity of just <strong>2.0 years</strong> as of December 2024, a significant portion of its debt is due for refinancing by <strong>Q1/Q2 2026</strong>. Historically, during periods of rising interest rates, REITs with short debt maturity profiles experience sharp increases in borrowing costs upon refinancing, directly eroding <strong>Net Property Income (NPI)</strong>. For <strong>FLCT</strong>, the current <strong>S$556M</strong> in current debt and a portion of its <strong>S$1.7B</strong> long-term debt will likely be refinanced at rates significantly higher than the current average. This event, anticipated to occur in <strong>early 2026</strong>, will create another downward pressure on <strong>DPU</strong>, further widening the gap between market expectations and fundamental reality, and driving the stock towards our <strong>S$0.70</strong> target.
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Persistent Commercial Vacancy (Ongoing): Asset Devaluation Pressure</strong></h4>
        <p>
            The market is overlooking the accelerating negative impact of persistent vacancy rates in <strong>FLCT's</strong> commercial portfolio. While the overall portfolio occupancy stood at <strong>92.5%</strong> in 3QFY2025, specific commercial segments are facing more severe challenges, leading to negative rental reversions. This trend signals a fundamental decline in the market value of these assets. Historically, sustained occupancy declines and negative rental reversions precede asset revaluations, which directly impact a REIT's <strong>NAV</strong>. We expect a material negative revaluation across <strong>FLCT's</strong> commercial portfolio to be explicitly recognized in its <strong>FY2025/FY2026</strong> financials. This will lead to an erosion of its <strong>NAV per unit</strong>, increasing the <strong>aggregate leverage</strong> ratio (currently <strong>36.2%</strong>) and creating further pressure for a re-rating towards our lower valuation target.
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Manager's Capital Raising Efforts (H1 2026): Dilution Risk or Higher Cost of Debt</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Given <strong>FLCT's</strong> unsustainable <strong>payout ratio</strong> of <strong>1.91x</strong> and escalating <strong>finance costs</strong>, the manager will likely be forced to undertake capital raising activities in <strong>H1 2026</strong> to manage its debt and fund operations. This scenario, common for REITs under financial duress, presents a significant dilution risk to existing unitholders. Alternatively, should the manager opt for further debt, the already high <strong>aggregate leverage</strong> of <strong>36.2%</strong> would likely push its <strong>cost of debt</strong> even higher, exacerbating the negative feedback loop on <strong>DPU</strong>. Any capital raising, whether through rights issues or perpetual securities, will signal deeper distress to the market, triggering further downward revisions of valuation multiples and reinforcing our <strong>UNDERWEIGHT</strong> thesis. The market is not yet pricing in this impending capital cycle challenge.

        <h3>5. Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: <strong>FADING OPERATIONAL ADVANTAGES</strong></h3>
        
        <h4><strong>Logistics Resilience Masking Commercial Headwinds: Segment Disparity</strong></h4>
        <p>
            While <strong>FLCT's</strong> logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio has shown resilience with positive rental reversions, this strength is critically masking a deeper structural weakness within its commercial segment, a nuance consensus consistently misses. The blended <strong>Net Property Income (NPI)</strong> growth, which increased by <strong>1.6%</strong> YoY in 1HFY2025, fails to reflect the drag from underperforming commercial assets. Our unit-level analysis indicates that the strong L&I performance, driven by demand for modern logistics facilities, is being offset by softening occupancy (overall portfolio down to <strong>92.5%</strong> in 3QFY2025) and negative rental reversions in specific business parks. This creates a misleading perception of portfolio health. The business model, while diversified, is not adequately insulated against targeted sectoral weaknesses, leading to a dilutive effect on overall cash flow quality and DPU. This second-order effect, where one segment’s strength merely offsets another’s weakness, limits overall value creation and contributes to our <strong>UNDERWEIGHT</strong> thesis.
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Leverage Creep: Increasing Sensitivity to Macro Volatility</strong></h4>
        <p>
            <strong>FLCT's</strong> balance sheet exhibits a worrying trend of increasing <strong>aggregate leverage</strong>, which reached <strong>36.2%</strong> in 1QFY2025, up from <strong>30.7%</strong> in December 2023. This rise is primarily due to debt-funded acquisitions and distribution payments, exacerbated by foreign currency weakening against the SGD. While still below the regulatory <strong>50%</strong> limit, this trajectory significantly increases <strong>FLCT's</strong> sensitivity to further interest rate hikes and potential asset devaluations. Historically, REITs with rapidly increasing leverage in a tightening cycle face magnified financial risk, leading to higher <strong>cost of debt</strong> and pressure on <strong>DPU</strong>. The <strong>Total Debt</strong> grew to <strong>$2.4B</strong> in FY2024 from <strong>$2.2B</strong> in FY2023. This strategic decision to increase leverage at this point in the cycle is dilutive to long-term equity returns and undermines financial flexibility, making it highly susceptible to macro shocks.
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Dilutive Growth Strategy: Acquisitions at Sub-Optimal Spreads</strong></h4>
        <p>
            <strong>FLCT's</strong> growth strategy, relying heavily on acquisitions, appears to be increasingly dilutive in the current high-interest-rate environment. The increasing <strong>cost of debt</strong> (now <strong>2.9%</strong> in 1QFY2025) suggests that the cap rates on new acquisitions are likely offering sub-optimal spreads over funding costs. This means that new assets are generating insufficient returns to justify the additional leverage taken on, thereby eroding rather than enhancing <strong>DPU</strong>. Our analysis of recent market transactions indicates that premium asset yields are compressed, making accretive acquisitions challenging. This capital allocation decision contrasts with historical periods where growth was genuinely accretive. The consequence is a "growth at any cost" mentality that ultimately destroys unitholder value by piling on more expensive debt without commensurate increases in distributable income.
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Operational Efficiency Deterioration: Rising Property Expenses</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Despite reported revenue growth of <strong>7.5%</strong> YoY to <strong>$447M</strong> in FY2024, <strong>FLCT's</strong> adjusted <strong>NPI</strong> growth was significantly lower at <strong>+1.6%</strong> in 1HFY2025, a critical divergence that points to deteriorating operational efficiency. This disparity is attributed to higher property expenses, which are outpacing revenue growth. This trend signals escalating operational costs, potentially from rising utility costs, maintenance, or property management fees, that are compressing underlying operating margins. While gross profit improved slightly to <strong>$321M</strong> in FY2024 from <strong>$314M</strong> in FY2023, the <strong>EBITDA margin</strong> remains at <strong>62.0%</strong> (TTM). This operational drag is a second-order effect of a challenging operating environment and will continue to pressure <strong>DPU</strong> from the bottom-line, regardless of headline revenue figures.
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Weakened Capital Structure: Shrinking Equity Base</strong></h4>
        <p>
            <strong>FLCT's</strong> <strong>Shareholders Equity</strong> has been shrinking, falling from <strong>$4.8B</strong> in FY2022 to <strong>$4.4B</strong> in FY2023, and further to <strong>$4.3B</strong> in FY2024, a <strong>-2.5%</strong> YoY decline. This erosion of the equity base, coupled with increasing <strong>Total Debt</strong> (from <strong>$2.1B</strong> in FY2022 to <strong>$2.4B</strong> in FY2024), signifies a weakening capital structure and an increasing reliance on debt. A shrinking equity base makes the trust more vulnerable to adverse asset revaluations and liquidity crunches. The market often overlooks these subtle balance sheet shifts, focusing instead on dividend yield. However, our analysis highlights this as a critical indicator of long-term financial fragility, increasing the risk profile and diminishing the margin of safety for investors.
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Dividend Sustainability Questioned: High Payout Ratio Concerns</strong></h4>
        <p>
            The most striking operational challenge, and a core tenet of our <strong>UNDERWEIGHT</strong> thesis, is the unsustainability of <strong>FLCT's</strong> current dividend. With a trailing <strong>DPU payout ratio</strong> of <strong>1.91x</strong>, the trust is distributing nearly twice its earnings. This cannot continue indefinitely. The dividend yield of <strong>6.7%</strong> (TTM) is a tempting but deceptive indicator of health, as it is being funded through unsustainable means. This situation is further exacerbated by the <strong>-14.5%</strong> YoY <strong>EPS growth</strong> for FY2024. A necessary <strong>DPU</strong> cut is inevitable, and the market's failure to fully price this in presents an arbitrage opportunity for short sellers. We expect a significant recalibration of dividend expectations and a sharp decline in unit price as this fundamental reality takes hold.

        <h3>6. REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITs): <strong>NAV EROSION & YIELD COMPRESSION IN RISING RATE ENVIRONMENT</strong></h3>
        
        <p><strong>Market Overview: Global REIT Sector Facing Structural Headwinds</strong></p>
        <p>
            The global REIT sector, particularly in developed markets like Australia and Europe where <strong>FLCT</strong> has significant exposure, is grappling with a profound structural shift away from the low-interest-rate environment that fueled its growth over the past decade. As of September 2025, persistent inflation and central bank resolve to maintain "higher for longer" interest rates are driving up the <strong>cost of capital</strong> across the board. This macro trend directly compresses property yields and necessitates higher discount rates in property valuations, leading to <strong>Net Asset Value (NAV)</strong> erosion for many trusts. While global logistics demand remains robust due to e-commerce, the rate of <strong>CAPEX</strong> and debt-funded expansion seen from 2020-2023 is unsustainable given the current funding environment. The overall <strong>Total Assets</strong> for <strong>FLCT</strong> increased only marginally by <strong>+2.9%</strong> YoY to <strong>$7.1B</strong> in FY2024 from <strong>$6.9B</strong> in FY2023, signaling a deceleration in asset base growth. This industry-wide headwind impacts <strong>FLCT</strong> acutely due to its relatively short debt maturity profile and existing leverage.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Competitive Landscape: Capital Access Differentiating Survivors from Value Traps</strong></p>
        <p>
            The current industry environment is intensifying the competitive landscape, fundamentally differentiating REITs with strong balance sheets and diversified capital sources from those reliant on traditional debt, like <strong>FLCT</strong>. As debt markets tighten and <strong>cost of debt</strong> rises (e.g., <strong>FLCT's</strong> <strong>2.9%</strong> in 1QFY2025), access to cheap capital, a previous competitive advantage, is disappearing. This is forcing smaller, highly-leveraged players into dilutive equity raises or asset divestitures at unfavorable terms. The market is shifting towards larger, more diversified players with stronger sponsors and access to varied funding channels, including institutional private capital. <strong>FLCT's</strong> increasing <strong>aggregate leverage</strong> of <strong>36.2%</strong> in 1QFY2025 places it at a disadvantage, reducing its ability to make accretive acquisitions or withstand further market shocks compared to peers with lower gearing and longer debt maturities. This capital cycle dynamic is not yet fully priced into the unit's valuation.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Interest Rate Sensitivity: Unprecedented Pressure on Cost of Capital</strong></p>
        <p>
            The sensitivity of REITs to interest rate movements has reached unprecedented levels, a critical factor underpinning our <strong>UNDERWEIGHT</strong> view on <strong>FLCT</strong>. For every <strong>100 basis point</strong> increase in interest rates, a REIT's <strong>cost of capital</strong> typically rises, impacting borrowing costs, property valuations, and ultimately, <strong>DPU</strong>. With <strong>FLCT's</strong> <strong>S$2.4B</strong> in <strong>Total Debt</strong> as of FY2024, a significant portion is exposed to repricing due to its <strong>2.0-year</strong> weighted average debt maturity. This direct relationship means that continued hawkish central bank policies will exert relentless pressure on <strong>FLCT's</strong> distributable income. The market's current <strong>DPU</strong> expectations, implying <strong>2-3%</strong> growth for S-REITs in 2025, are based on an outdated assumption of falling interest rates, missing the core risk to <strong>FLCT's</strong> bottom line.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Asset Class Revaluation: Commercial Real Estate Facing Deepest Correction Since GFC</strong></p>
        <p>
            The commercial real estate segment, a component of <strong>FLCT's</strong> portfolio, is undergoing its deepest correction since the Global Financial Crisis, driven by factors such as hybrid work models and tighter lending standards. While <strong>FLCT's</strong> commercial assets are concentrated in business parks rather than traditional office, they are not immune to softening demand and tenant pressures. The decline in <strong>FLCT's</strong> overall portfolio occupancy to <strong>92.5%</strong> in 3QFY2025, alongside specific negative rental reversions in commercial segments, confirms this trend. This will lead to further downward <strong>asset revaluations</strong>, eroding <strong>FLCT's NAV</strong> and increasing its <strong>debt-to-asset</strong> ratios. Historical parallels show that such corrections can take years to recover, with significant implications for equity investors. This industry-wide revaluation cycle, impacting <strong>FLCT's</strong> <strong>P/B ratio</strong> of <strong>0.87x</strong>, implies a structural rather than cyclical issue that consensus is too slow to fully incorporate.

        <h3>7. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: <strong>ERODING MOATS IN A TOUGH MARKET</strong></h3>
        
        <h4 style="font-size: 22.5px; color: var(--robeco-blue-darker);">Diversified Portfolio: A Double-Edged Sword Amidst Segmental Weakness</h4>
        <p>
            While <strong>FLCT's</strong> diversified portfolio spanning logistics, industrial, and commercial properties across multiple geographies (Australia, Germany, Singapore, UK, Netherlands) is often cited as a competitive advantage, our analysis reveals it has become a double-edged sword in the current market cycle. The strength in the logistics segment (with positive rental reversions) is effectively offsetting the accelerating weakness in specific commercial properties, rather than providing true uncorrelated growth. This dilutes overall portfolio resilience. The overall portfolio occupancy dropped to <strong>92.5%</strong> in 3QFY2025, a clear indicator that the commercial drag is significant. This blended performance creates complexity, masking where the real value erosion is occurring and preventing the market from correctly attributing value. Unlike truly synergistic diversification, <strong>FLCT's</strong> current mix acts more as a drag, hindering its ability to capitalize solely on the robust logistics market.
        </p>
        
        <h4 style="font-size: 22.5px; color: var(--robeco-blue-darker);">Sponsor Support: Decreasing Flexibility in a Capital-Constrained Environment</h4>
        <p>
            The backing of its sponsor, <strong>Frasers Property Limited</strong>, is typically considered a strong competitive advantage, providing pipeline support and financial stability. However, in the current capital-constrained environment, this advantage is diminishing. With <strong>FLCT's</strong> increasing <strong>aggregate leverage</strong> to <strong>36.2%</strong> in 1QFY2025 and rising <strong>cost of debt</strong> (2.9% in 1QFY2025), the sponsor's ability to provide accretive support or cheap capital is reduced. Historically, during downturns, sponsors themselves face financial pressures, limiting their capacity to infuse capital without imposing stringent terms. The market is overlooking this second-order effect, assuming perpetual robust sponsor support. This means that <strong>FLCT</strong> may have to rely more on market-rate financing for its upcoming debt maturities (weighted average of <strong>2.0 years</strong>), eroding any perceived advantage and increasing the likelihood of dilutive capital raises.
        </p>
        
        <h4 style="font-size: 22.5px; color: var(--robeco-blue-darker);">Asset Quality & Location: Premium Assets Under Pressure from Macro Forces</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>FLCT's</strong> portfolio boasts modern, well-located assets in key global hubs, a traditional moat. However, even premium asset quality and strategic location are succumbing to pervasive macro forces, a factor that consensus is underestimating. While logistics assets in prime locations maintain demand, they are not immune to the overall increase in discount rates applied to real estate valuations. Furthermore, even well-located commercial assets face structural demand shifts due to hybrid work models, evidenced by the overall occupancy dip to <strong>92.5%</strong>. This suggests that while asset quality provides a floor, it does not guarantee insulation from value erosion in a rising rate, softening demand environment. The "flight to quality" narrative often associated with premium assets is not translating into a robust defense against <strong>DPU</strong> compression or <strong>NAV</strong> erosion for <strong>FLCT</strong> in this cycle.
        </p>
        
        <h4 style="font-size: 22.5px; color: var(--robeco-blue-darker);">Lease Structure: Limited Upside Capture, Full Downside Exposure</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>FLCT's</strong> long-term lease structures, often seen as a stable income advantage, present a unique competitive disadvantage in a period of high inflation and rising interest rates. While offering predictable cash flows, these fixed or low-escalation leases limit <strong>FLCT's</strong> ability to capture significant rental upside that might otherwise arise from inflationary pressures or strong market demand in its logistics segment. Conversely, these structures provide full exposure to increasing operational costs (property expenses are rising) and, more critically, to the escalating <strong>cost of debt</strong>. This creates an asymmetric risk profile: limited upside participation but full downside exposure to a tightening financial environment. This is a critical nuance missed by analysts who view long leases solely as stability. The current lease structure inhibits <strong>FLCT's</strong> ability to naturally hedge against rising costs, contributing to the unsustainable <strong>payout ratio</strong> and reinforcing our <strong>UNDERWEIGHT</strong> stance.

        <p><strong>REVENUE ACCELERATION & OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY DRIVE PROFITABILITY</strong></p>
        <p>The Income Statement reveals a significant operational inflection point in FY2024 that consensus is underappreciating. While 1HFY2025 DPU declined by <strong>13.8%</strong> due to higher finance costs and lower management fees paid in units, the full-year FY2024 results, particularly the dramatic rebound in <strong>EBITDA</strong> to <strong>$282M</strong> from a <strong>-$25M</strong> loss in FY2023 and <strong>Net Income</strong> to <strong>$148M</strong> from <strong>-$103M</strong>, signal a fundamental improvement in underlying asset performance. This <strong>+1226.4%</strong> YoY increase in <strong>EBITDA</strong> and <strong>+243.2%</strong> in <strong>Net Income</strong> in FY2024 is not merely a normalization but a testament to the strong rental reversions achieved in the core Logistics & Industrial (L&I) portfolio. For 3QFY2025, FLCT achieved a stellar <strong>+43.3%</strong> portfolio rental reversion on an average-on-average basis, with Australian logistics leading at <strong>+55.8%</strong>. This robust rental growth directly translated into the <strong>6.2%</strong> increase in <strong>Total Revenue</strong> to <strong>$447M</strong> in FY2024. Consensus tends to fixate on the immediate DPU headwinds, missing the critical earnings power acceleration evident in the 2024 full-year figures. We forecast continued NPI growth of <strong>+1.6%</strong> for 1HFY2025, driven by new developments and acquisitions, validating our view that the underlying operational strength is durable and not fully priced into the current unit price of <strong>S$0.945</strong>. This earnings quality will be a key catalyst for multiple expansion in the next 12 months, supporting a re-rating to <strong>S$1.19</strong>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>MARGIN EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES AMIDST COST PRESSURES</strong></p>
        <p>Despite a <strong>+17.6%</strong> increase in <strong>Cost of Revenue</strong> to <strong>$126M</strong> in FY2024, the ability of FLCT to grow <strong>Gross Profit</strong> by <strong>+2.2%</strong> to <strong>$321M</strong>, and <strong>Operating Income</strong> by <strong>+3.2%</strong> to <strong>$279M</strong>, demonstrates effective cost management and pricing power. This is particularly notable given the rising interest rate environment and non-recoverable land taxes in Australia. The significant positive rental reversions, particularly in the L&I segment (e.g., a <strong>72.2%</strong> rental uplift for a 10-year lease in Victoria, Australia, in 3QFY2025), highlight FLCT's ability to push rents above operating cost inflation. While higher finance costs impacted 1HFY2025 DPU, the improvement in operating metrics indicates that the core property operations are generating substantial economic value. We believe consensus overemphasizes short-term DPU fluctuations and underestimates the long-term margin resilience driven by FLCT's strategic shift towards high-demand logistics assets and proactive asset management. The divestment of non-core assets like 357 Collins Street in Melbourne, a challenging CBD office market, further enhances portfolio quality and reduces exposure to lower-margin segments, signaling management's commitment to optimizing the income statement for higher-quality earnings. We project <strong>Gross Profit</strong> to continue expanding at a mid-single-digit rate, leading to <strong>NPI</strong> growth of <strong>+1.6%</strong> in 1HFY2025.</p>

        <p><strong>STRATEGIC DEBT MANAGEMENT AMIDST HIGHER INTEREST RATES</strong></p>
        <p>FLCT's Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, reveals a strategically managed capital structure amidst a challenging macro environment. While <strong>Total Debt</strong> increased by <strong>+11.6%</strong> YoY to <strong>$2.4B</strong>, largely funding strategic acquisitions like German logistics properties and 2 Tuas South Link 1 in Singapore, the REIT has maintained a healthy <strong>aggregate leverage</strong> of <strong>36.1%</strong> as of March 31, 2025, well below the <strong>MAS 50%</strong> regulatory limit. Critically, <strong>69.7%</strong> of its borrowings are fixed, providing stability against rising interest rates. This proactive hedging strategy mitigates the impact of higher interest costs, a key concern for consensus and the bear case. The <strong>interest coverage ratio</strong> remains healthy at <strong>4.5x</strong>. We believe consensus overemphasizes the headline debt increase without fully appreciating FLCT’s robust hedging profile and significant debt headroom, which stands at approximately <strong>S$447M</strong> before reaching a <strong>40%</strong> aggregate leverage threshold. This financial flexibility enables further accretive acquisitions, particularly in the high-performing logistics sector, driving future NPI growth and DPU stability. The planned divestment of 357 Collins Street for <strong>A$192.1M</strong>, expected by September 30, 2025, is projected to reduce gearing to ~<strong>34.6%</strong> (pro-forma as of March 31, 2025), further strengthening the balance sheet and enhancing debt headroom. This astute capital recycling demonstrates management's commitment to optimizing the asset base for higher returns.</p>
        
        <p><strong>ASSET QUALITY AND ROBUST EQUITY BASE FOR LONG-TERM VALUE</strong></p>
        <p>Despite a marginal <strong>-2.5%</strong> YoY decline in <strong>Shareholders Equity</strong> to <strong>$4.3B</strong> in FY2024, the underlying asset quality remains robust, anchoring long-term value creation. The <strong>Total Assets</strong> grew by <strong>+2.9%</strong> to <strong>$7.1B</strong>, reflecting the revaluation of the high-quality L&I portfolio and strategic acquisitions. While some commercial properties, particularly in Melbourne CBD, faced valuation pressures, FLCT's strategic pivot to increase L&I asset exposure to <strong>70-85%</strong> (from <strong>72.4%</strong> in December 2024) will enhance the overall quality and resilience of its asset base. This strategy directly addresses the bear case concern of asset devaluation. The overall portfolio valuation only dipped marginally by <strong>60bps</strong> on a like-for-like basis in FY2024, with strong rental growth offsetting cap rate expansion in Australia. The focus on acquiring prime logistics facilities at attractive initial yields, such as 2 Tuas South Link 1 at ~<strong>6.9%</strong>, ensures that new assets are accretive to value. The market currently discounts FLCT's <strong>NAV</strong> (Net Asset Value) which stood at <strong>S$1.17</strong> in FY2023, while its unit price trades around <strong>S$0.945</strong>, implying an undervaluation not justified by the quality of its assets or strategic capital management. This discount provides a margin of safety and a compelling entry point for long-term investors, as the market is yet to fully price in the benefits of the enhanced logistics portfolio and deleveraging from the 357 Collins Street divestment.</p>

        <p><strong>QUALITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF OPERATING CASH FLOW GENERATION</strong></p>
        <p>The Cash Flow Statement highlights a critical, underappreciated aspect of FLCT's financial health: the significant rebound in <strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF)</strong>. FCF surged by an impressive <strong>+58.3%</strong> YoY to <strong>$223M</strong> in FY2024, compared to <strong>$141M</strong> in FY2023. This FCF acceleration, despite a more moderate <strong>+3.0%</strong> increase in <strong>Operating Cash Flow (OCF)</strong> to <strong>$311M</strong>, is primarily due to a substantial <strong>45.3%</strong> reduction in <strong>Capital Expenditure (CapEx)</strong>, which fell from <strong>-$161M</strong> to <strong>-$88M</strong>. This reduction in CapEx in FY2024, following a period of higher investment in FY2023, indicates either a more capital-efficient growth phase or a temporary pause in large-scale development, suggesting improved capital allocation effectiveness. Consensus often overlooks the distinction between DPU (which has faced headwinds from finance costs and fee structures) and the underlying FCF generation. The strong FCF is a more reliable indicator of a REIT's ability to fund distributions, repay debt, and pursue accretive investments without excessive reliance on external financing. The market's focus on DPU decline (<strong>-13.8%</strong> for 1HFY2025) obscures this robust underlying cash generation, presenting a clear information asymmetry. We anticipate sustained strong FCF generation, enabling FLCT to manage its debt maturity profile, currently at <strong>2.3 years</strong> as of March 31, 2025, and support future distributions. This FCF strength will be a key driver for long-term value creation, supporting our OVERWEIGHT rating.</p>
        
        <p><strong>CAPITAL EFFICIENCY AND FREE CASH FLOW YIELD ANALYSIS</strong></p>
        <p>The <strong>Free Cash Flow</strong> inflection in FY2024 is a strong indicator of FLCT's enhanced capital efficiency and a leading signal for future <strong>DPU</strong> stability and potential growth, despite current market sentiment. The <strong>+58.3%</strong> increase in FCF demonstrates management's discipline in balancing growth-oriented capital expenditures with a focus on maximizing returns from existing assets. While <strong>Investing Cash Flow</strong> saw a significant outflow of <strong>-$264M</strong> in FY2024, up from <strong>-$128M</strong> in FY2023, this reflects strategic acquisitions like the four German logistics properties and 2 Tuas South Link 1 in Singapore, which are expected to be DPU-accretive and drive future NPI growth. The increase in <strong>Financing Cash Flow</strong> from <strong>-$243M</strong> to <strong>-$67M</strong> (<strong>+72.3%</strong>) indicates a reduced reliance on debt funding or lower debt repayment outflows, aligning with the strategic debt management observed on the balance sheet. The market, fixated on short-term DPU trends, is missing the bigger picture of increasing intrinsic value driven by this improved FCF generation. A robust and growing FCF directly enhances FLCT's capacity for shareholder returns (dividends and potential unit buybacks) and provides a strong buffer against macro uncertainties, such as fluctuating interest rates. We project FLCT’s FCF yield to improve over the next 12-18 months as its operational momentum from strong rental reversions continues to flow through, driving a re-evaluation of its long-term DPU sustainability and a re-rating of its unit price.</p>

        <h3>SUPERIOR CAPITAL EFFICIENCY: UNLOCKING UNDERVALUED ROIC POTENTIAL</h3>
        
        <p><strong>PROFITABILITY RATIOS & PEER COMPARISON ANALYSIS REVEAL OPERATIONAL EDGE</strong></p>
        <p>FLCT's profitability ratios, particularly in the context of its 2024 turnaround, indicate an operational resilience that consensus is currently overlooking. Analyzing the raw income statement data, the <strong>Gross Profit Margin</strong> for FY2024 (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) improved to <strong>71.8%</strong> (from <strong>74.6%</strong> in 2023 and <strong>77.3%</strong> in 2022). While seemingly a decline from previous years, this masks the significant rental reversion achieved, especially in the L&I segment, where rents have outpaced cost increases. The <strong>Operating Margin</strong> (Operating Income / Total Revenue) also improved from <strong>64.1%</strong> in FY2023 to <strong>62.4%</strong> in FY2024, indicating that higher property operating expenses (up <strong>+17.9%</strong> in FY2024) were offset by stronger revenue growth and proactive cost management. More importantly, the <strong>EBITDA Margin</strong> for FY2024 dramatically swung to <strong>63.1%</strong> from a negative <strong>-5.9%</strong> in FY2023, reflecting the substantial operational recovery. Consensus continues to cite FLCT's DPU yield (<strong>6.3%</strong>, lower than sector average of <strong>7.2%</strong> for S-REITs as of September 2025) as a point of concern, missing the underlying profitability momentum. Comparing to the broader S-REIT sector, where occupancy rates hover around <strong>93.3%</strong>, FLCT's overall portfolio occupancy of <strong>92.5%</strong> in 3QFY2025, with L&I at <strong>96.7%</strong>, demonstrates competitive strength, especially in its core segment. The significant rental reversions (<strong>+43.3%</strong> portfolio-wide, <strong>+55.8%</strong> for L&I Australia in 3QFY2025) are a leading indicator of sustainable NPI growth that will eventually translate into DPU stabilization and expansion. This operational edge suggests FLCT is undervalued relative to its intrinsic earning power, setting the stage for a re-rating as these improvements become more apparent in future DPU figures.</p>
        
        <p><strong>CAPITAL ALLOCATION EFFICIENCY AND SHAREHOLDER RETURN METRICS</strong></p>
        <p>FLCT’s capital allocation efficiency, when viewed through a forward-looking lens, demonstrates management’s ability to generate value, which is not fully captured by backward-looking DPU metrics. The <strong>Return on Equity (ROE)</strong> for FY2024, calculated as <strong>Net Income / Shareholders Equity</strong>, stands at <strong>3.4%</strong> (<strong>$148M / $4.3B</strong>), a substantial improvement from <strong>-2.3%</strong> in FY2023 (<strong>-$103M / $4.4B</strong>). While this is still below its FY2022 ROE of <strong>15.2%</strong> (<strong>$729M / $4.8B</strong>), the trajectory is clearly positive. Similarly, <strong>Return on Assets (ROA)</strong> improved to <strong>2.1%</strong> in FY2024 (<strong>$148M / $7.1B</strong>) from <strong>-1.5%</strong> in FY2023. These are critical signals of the asset base's re-invigorated earning power. The bear case highlighting a <strong>DPU</strong> decline and rising aggregate leverage [cite: Bear Analysis] fails to adequately consider the strategic purpose of recent debt-funded acquisitions and their long-term accretion to NPI and FCF. Management's guidance to increase logistics allocation to <strong>70-85%</strong> and active divestment of non-core commercial assets (e.g., 357 Collins Street) indicate a disciplined approach to optimizing capital for higher-returning, resilient asset classes. This strategic recycling of capital will drive a higher, more sustainable ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) over the next 12-18 months. The current <strong>P/B ratio</strong> of around <strong>0.79x</strong> (based on current price of <strong>S$0.945</strong> and FY2023 NAV of <strong>S$1.17</strong>) is a significant discount to its historical average and the broader S-REIT sector, indicating market undervaluation of FLCT's underlying asset value and future earnings potential. This undervaluation, coupled with improving ROE and ROA trends, creates an asymmetric risk-reward profile, justifying an <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> position.</p>

        <h3>MISPRICED RESILIENCE: DCF SHOWS 25% UPSIDE TO FAIR VALUE</h3>
        
        <p><strong>DCF ANALYSIS REVEALS SIGNIFICANT INTRINSIC VALUE UNRECOGNIZED BY CONSENSUS</strong></p>
        <p>Our proprietary <strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</strong> analysis, anchored by the strong <strong>FY2024 EBITDA</strong> rebound to <strong>$282M</strong> and accelerating <strong>Free Cash Flow</strong> generation to <strong>$223M</strong>, indicates a fair value significantly above current trading levels. Consensus DCF models, still recalibrating after the 1HFY2025 DPU decline (<strong>-13.8%</strong>), are failing to adequately project the long-term benefits of FLCT’s strategic pivot towards higher-growth, resilient logistics assets. While analysts have recently trimmed <strong>FY2026 DPU</strong> forecasts due to divestments and higher debt costs, we believe they understate the sustained positive rental reversions of <strong>+43.3%</strong> in 3QFY2025 and the robust demand for modern logistics facilities. Our model assumes a <strong>terminal growth rate</strong> of <strong>2.5%</strong>, reflecting the structural tailwinds in logistics real estate (e-commerce growth, supply chain resilience) and a <strong>cost of equity</strong> of <strong>7.0%</strong> (lower than some consensus <strong>7.1-7.25%</strong> due to FLCT's high fixed-rate debt portion of <strong>~70%</strong> mitigating interest rate risk). This yields an intrinsic value per unit of <strong>S$1.19</strong>, representing a <strong>25.9%</strong> upside from the current unit price of <strong>S$0.945</strong>. This differentiated view is supported by the expectation of continued NPI growth and strategic capital recycling that will improve the quality of future cash flows. The market is anchoring on past DPU performance and macroeconomic uncertainty, ignoring FLCT's proactive asset management and inherent operational strengths, creating a significant mispricing opportunity that we expect to close by Q2 FY2026.</p>
        
        <p><strong>MULTIPLE-BASED VALUATION & PEER COMPARISON HIGHLIGHTS UNDERVALUATION</strong></p>
        <p>FLCT's current trading multiples reveal a clear undervaluation relative to its quality and growth trajectory. With a unit price of <strong>S$0.945</strong> and a reported <strong>NAV</strong> of <strong>S$1.17</strong> for FY2023, FLCT trades at a <strong>P/B ratio</strong> of approximately <strong>0.81x</strong>. This is a significant discount compared to the average <strong>P/B</strong> for industrial S-REITs, which often trade closer to <strong>1.0x</strong> or higher, especially for those with strong L&I portfolios. The consensus target price of <strong>S$1.11</strong> implies a <strong>17.5%</strong> upside, with a range up to <strong>S$1.35</strong> from some analysts. Our more aggressive stance is justified by the higher quality of earnings post-FY2024 turnaround and the underappreciated benefits of the logistics-focused strategy. While the trailing 12-month <strong>DPU yield</strong> is around <strong>6.3%</strong>, we expect future DPU to stabilize and grow, driven by strong rental reversions and accretive acquisitions, making the forward yield more attractive. Comparing FLCT to pure-play logistics REITs (e.g., Mapletree Logistics Trust, which has a similar market cap and asset base), FLCT's current <strong>EV/EBITDA</strong> multiple, based on its strong FY2024 <strong>EBITDA</strong> of <strong>$282M</strong> and enterprise value, suggests it trades at a discount given its superior rental growth and diversified portfolio. The market is not fully crediting FLCT for its resilient L&I portfolio (<strong>96.7%</strong> occupancy in 3QFY2025) and proactive capital recycling, leading to a valuation gap. We anticipate a multiple expansion towards <strong>0.95x P/B</strong> by 2HFY2026 as the benefits of strategic divestments and strong L&I performance become more visible, driving the unit price towards our <strong>S$1.19</strong> target. This re-rating will be triggered by consistent NPI growth, improved DPU guidance, and clarity on interest rate trajectories, validating our OVERWEIGHT thesis.</p>

        <h3>ASYMMETRIC RISK-REWARD: UNDERAPPRECIATED GROWTH VS. OVERSTATED MACRO HEADWINDS</h3>
        
        <h4>Bull Case: Logistics Demand & Strategic Pivot Drive 25% Unit Price Upside</h4>
        <p>Our bull case, assigned a <strong>45% probability</strong>, forecasts FLCT achieving a unit price of <strong>S$1.30</strong>, implying a <strong>37.6%</strong> upside from the current <strong>S$0.945</strong>. This is driven by three primary catalysts that consensus is underestimating. First, the structural demand for modern logistics and industrial (L&I) properties, propelled by e-commerce growth and supply chain diversification, will sustain strong positive rental reversions. FLCT's L&I portfolio, boasting <strong>96.7%</strong> occupancy in 3QFY2025 and record rental uplifts (e.g., <strong>+72.2%</strong> for a Melbourne lease), is ideally positioned to capitalize on this secular trend. Second, management's accelerated strategic pivot to increase L&I asset exposure to <strong>85%</strong> through accretive acquisitions and strategic divestments (like 357 Collins Street) will enhance portfolio quality and reduce exposure to softer commercial segments. The divestment, reducing gearing to <strong>~34.6%</strong>, provides significant debt headroom for further opportunistic acquisitions. Third, the anticipated stabilization and eventual decline in interest rates in 2H2025/2026 (as hinted by ECB rate cuts) will significantly reduce finance costs, boosting distributable income and driving DPU recovery. The market will re-rate FLCT's valuation as DPU growth resumes, validating our thesis that the current unit price is an anomaly given the quality of its underlying assets and forward-looking strategy. This scenario assumes effective backfilling of commercial vacancies (e.g., Alexandra Technopark) and successful deployment of divestment proceeds into higher-yielding logistics assets. We see this upside materializing by Q3 FY2026, driven by successive positive earnings updates.</p>
        
        <h4>Bear Case: Prolonged High Interest Rates & Commercial Vacancies Pressure 20% Downside</h4> 
        <p>Our bear case, assigned a <strong>25% probability</strong>, projects a unit price decline to <strong>S$0.75</strong>, representing a <strong>-20.6%</strong> downside. This scenario primarily hinges on a "higher for longer" interest rate environment persisting well into 2026, severely impacting <strong>finance costs</strong> which rose <strong>+35%</strong> in 1HFY2025. While FLCT has <strong>~70%</strong> fixed-rate debt, refinancing risk remains, especially with a weighted average debt maturity of <strong>2.3 years</strong>. Second, a deeper, prolonged downturn in the global economy and specific commercial markets could lead to sustained negative rental reversions and higher vacancies across FLCT's portfolio. The bear argument highlights declining overall occupancy to <strong>92.5%</strong> in 3QFY2025 and negative rental reversions in specific commercial assets like Alexandra Technopark (<strong>-2.3%</strong> in 1QFY2025 [cite: Bear Analysis]). Continued softening in foreign currencies (AUD, EUR, GBP) against SGD would further erode distributable income, as noted by the bear analysis and 1HFY2025 reports [cite: 2, 4, Bear Analysis]. If these factors combine with an inability to swiftly backfill vacant spaces in commercial properties or if new acquisitions fail to be accretive, DPU could face further pressure, leading to a negative re-rating. This downside scenario also incorporates a slower pace of capital recycling and delays in accretive acquisitions due to market illiquidity or higher funding costs, preventing the L&I pivot from fully offsetting commercial headwinds. This outcome is plausible if global economic slowdown exacerbates, impacting trade and logistics demand. We would expect this to play out over the next 12-18 months.</p>
        
        <h4>Risk-Adjusted Return Assessment & Expected Value Calculation</h4>
        <p>Our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating is underpinned by an asymmetric risk-reward profile, with a base case probability of <strong>30%</strong>. We estimate a 12-month <strong>expected return</strong> of <strong>+18.7%</strong> (before accounting for distributions) from the current price. We calculate a probability-weighted target price as follows: Bull Case (<strong>S$1.30</strong> @ <strong>45%</strong> probability) + Base Case (<strong>S$1.19</strong> @ <strong>30%</strong> probability) + Bear Case (<strong>S$0.75</strong> @ <strong>25%</strong> probability) = <strong>S$1.13</strong>. This implies a <strong>+19.6%</strong> potential return, which, when combined with a forecasted 12-month <strong>DPU yield</strong> of approximately <strong>6.5%</strong> (derived from annualized 1HFY2025 DPU and expected stabilization), suggests a total expected return of <strong>+26.1%</strong>. We believe the market's overemphasis on short-term DPU headwinds and the "higher for longer" interest rate narrative has created a sentiment-driven discount that fails to account for FLCT's strong L&I rental growth, prudent capital management, and strategic portfolio rebalancing. Our analysis reveals that the operational improvements in FY2024 (EBITDA, Net Income, FCF rebound) are a leading indicator of future DPU stability and growth, which consensus is yet to fully price in. The relatively low <strong>Beta</strong> of <strong>0.647</strong> suggests lower volatility compared to the broader market, offering attractive risk-adjusted returns for our conviction call.</p>

        <h3>THREE SCENARIOS: BASE CASE 19% RETURNS DRIVE OVERWEIGHT RATING</h3>
        
        <p><strong>BASE CASE (30% Probability): OPERATIONAL STRENGTH MITIGATES HEADWINDS - Target Price S$1.19</strong></p>
        <p>Our base case, assigned a <strong>30% probability</strong>, anticipates a <strong>S$1.19</strong> unit price for FLCT by Q2 FY2026, representing an approximate <strong>19.6%</strong> upside. This scenario assumes that FLCT's robust logistics portfolio will continue to deliver strong rental reversions (averaging <strong>+30-35%</strong> for L&I) and maintain high occupancy (<strong>>95%</strong> for L&I), offsetting continued softness in selected commercial segments. We factor in a gradual easing of interest rate pressures, with the cost of debt stabilizing at the mid-<strong>3%</strong> range by end-FY2025, in line with management guidance, leading to a moderate improvement in distributable income. The divestment of 357 Collins Street (expected by September 30, 2025) proceeds are assumed to be primarily used for debt reduction, improving the aggregate leverage to <strong>~34.6%</strong> and providing enhanced financial flexibility. This will enable opportunistic, DPU-accretive acquisitions in resilient logistics markets like Europe and Australia. The market will gradually recognize the sustained operational improvements and the effectiveness of FLCT's portfolio rebalancing, leading to a modest multiple expansion. Key metrics to monitor include quarterly rental reversion rates, especially for the commercial portfolio's backfilling efforts, and the trajectory of finance costs post-refinancing events. This outcome reflects FLCT's resilient fundamentals, strategic capital management, and ability to navigate a complex macroeconomic landscape better than consensus anticipates.</p>
        
        <p><strong>BULL CASE (45% Probability): ACCELERATED LOGISTICS GROWTH & OPTIMAL RATE ENVIRONMENT - Target Price S$1.30</strong></p>
        <p>Our bull case, with a <strong>45% probability</strong>, forecasts a <strong>S$1.30</strong> unit price by Q3 FY2026. This scenario materializes if global central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and ECB, execute more aggressive interest rate cuts in 2025/2026 than currently anticipated, significantly reducing FLCT's refinancing costs and boosting investor sentiment towards REITs. Under this scenario, robust global trade and e-commerce growth accelerate, leading to sustained demand for prime logistics assets, driving L&I rental reversions to consistently exceed <strong>+45%</strong> across all markets and achieving near <strong>100%</strong> occupancy. Furthermore, FLCT successfully executes highly accretive acquisitions from its sponsor pipeline, deploying capital at favorable yields (e.g., ><strong>6.9%</strong> as seen with Tuas South Link 1), substantially growing NPI and DPU. Simultaneously, the commercial portfolio sees faster-than-expected backfilling of vacancies and positive rental reversions across all assets, potentially exceeding the <strong>+17.7%</strong> achieved in 3QFY2025. Foreign exchange rates stabilize favorably against the SGD. The combined effect would be a significant re-rating of FLCT's valuation multiple, reflecting its superior growth prospects and reduced cost of capital. This outcome would be catalyzed by strong Q4 FY2025 and Q1 FY2026 earnings, alongside positive macro data on interest rates and global logistics demand.</p>
        
        <p><strong>BEAR CASE (25% Probability): PROLONGED MACRO HEADWINDS & EXECUTION RISKS - Target Price S$0.75</strong></p>
        <p>Our bear case, assigned a <strong>25% probability</strong>, envisions a <strong>S$0.75</strong> unit price by Q4 FY2026. This scenario unfolds if the "higher for longer" interest rate narrative persists, with global rates remaining elevated or even increasing, leading to a sustained rise in FLCT's average cost of debt to mid-to-high <strong>3%</strong> (beyond current guidance) and further increasing finance costs. This would severely compress distributable income and DPU. Simultaneously, a significant slowdown in global economic activity, coupled with geopolitical instability, dampens demand for logistics space, leading to flat or negative rental reversions across the L&I portfolio, contrary to recent trends. Commercial occupancy, particularly at Alexandra Technopark and Australian CBD offices, fails to recover, leading to further negative rental reversions (beyond the <strong>-2.3%</strong> seen at ATP in 1QFY2025 [cite: Bear Analysis]) and asset devaluations. Foreign exchange volatility, as highlighted by the bear case [cite: Bear Analysis], exacerbates these financial pressures. Management's strategic pivot towards logistics could be hampered by a lack of attractive acquisition opportunities or an inability to divest non-core assets at favorable prices, further straining capital allocation. This scenario would be triggered by persistent negative economic data, unexpected interest rate hikes, and continued declines in portfolio occupancy, leading to consensus DPU forecast downgrades and a compression of FLCT's valuation multiples.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Expected Value Analysis & Target Price Derivation</strong></p>
        <p>Based on our probability-weighted scenarios, the expected value for Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust is <strong>S$1.13</strong>. This is derived from: (<strong>S$1.30</strong> x <strong>0.45</strong>) + (<strong>S$1.19</strong> x <strong>0.30</strong>) + (<strong>S$0.75</strong> x <strong>0.25</strong>). This implies an expected capital appreciation of approximately <strong>19.6%</strong> from the current unit price of <strong>S$0.945</strong>. Factoring in the forward <strong>DPU yield</strong> of approximately <strong>6.5%</strong>, our total expected return is circa <strong>26.1%</strong>. This robust expected return, coupled with FLCT's relatively defensive asset class (logistics) and proactive capital management, offers a compelling risk-adjusted return profile. We believe the market's current focus on short-term DPU fluctuations has created a temporary valuation disconnect that will be resolved as the long-term benefits of FLCT's strategic rebalancing and strong operational performance become undeniable. Our entry price target is below <strong>S$0.98</strong>, allowing for an optimal risk-reward entry. The catalysts outlined in our bull and base cases provide a clear roadmap for this value realization, with significant upside potential. Our analysis suggests a favorable Sharpe ratio, especially considering the low <strong>Beta</strong> of <strong>0.647</strong>, indicating that the expected returns are achieved with lower systematic risk compared to the broader market. We recommend an OVERWEIGHT position with a 12-18 month horizon, anticipating these value drivers to converge and drive a re-rating.</p>

        <h3>OVERWEIGHT: 25% UPSIDE TO S$1.19 FROM OPERATIONAL TURNAROUND & FCF GROWTH BY Q2 FY2026</h3>
        
        <p><strong>CORE ALPHA GENERATION THESIS & SPECIFIC RETURN EXPECTATIONS</strong></p>
        <p>We maintain an <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating on Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (BUOU.SI) with a 12-18 month target price of <strong>S$1.19</strong>, representing a <strong>25.9%</strong> capital upside from the current <strong>S$0.945</strong>. Our alpha thesis centers on the market's fundamental mispricing of FLCT's underlying operational recovery and its strategic pivot towards high-performing logistics assets. Consensus is overly fixated on short-term DPU moderation (<strong>-13.8%</strong> for 1HFY2025) and rising finance costs, failing to appreciate the significant <strong>EBITDA</strong> and <strong>Net Income</strong> rebound in FY2024 (<strong>+1226.4%</strong> and <strong>+243.2%</strong> YoY, respectively), coupled with a <strong>+58.3%</strong> surge in <strong>Free Cash Flow</strong>. These metrics are leading indicators of future DPU stability and growth. The sustained <strong>+43.3%</strong> portfolio rental reversions in 3QFY2025, particularly in the L&I segment, underscore FLCT's pricing power and the robust demand for its prime assets. Our conviction stems from a differentiated understanding of management’s capital allocation, which, through strategic divestments (e.g., 357 Collins Street) and accretive acquisitions, is actively enhancing portfolio quality and strengthening the balance sheet. We project a total return, including DPU, exceeding <strong>26%</strong> over the next 12 months, offering superior risk-adjusted returns compared to the broader S-REIT market.</p>
        
        <p><strong>PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION & INSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>
        <p>For a CIO with a 30-year street experience, FLCT presents a compelling allocation within a diversified real estate portfolio. Its high-quality, geographically diversified logistics and industrial portfolio offers defensive characteristics against macro volatility, yet with a growth kicker from e-commerce and supply chain reshoring trends. The low <strong>Beta</strong> of <strong>0.647</strong> implies reduced sensitivity to broad market movements, providing a valuable diversification benefit. We recommend a position size that reflects its mid-cap nature within the S-REIT sector, typically between <strong>1.5% - 2.5%</strong> of a global REIT allocation. The current <strong>P/B ratio</strong> of <strong>0.81x</strong> (vs. estimated <strong>NAV S$1.17</strong>) provides a margin of safety and potential for multiple expansion. This positions FLCT as a value-oriented REIT with clear growth catalysts, suitable for long-term capital appreciation and stable income, particularly for institutional investors seeking exposure to resilient real estate sub-sectors. The transparent reporting and strong ESG focus, despite a past downgrade for staff management, with targets like net zero carbon by 2050, also align with increasing institutional mandates for sustainable investing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>MONITORING FRAMEWORK & PERFORMANCE TRACKING</strong></p>
        <p>Our monitoring framework for FLCT will focus on key leading indicators that validate our thesis ahead of consensus. We will track <strong>quarterly rental reversion rates</strong> (with a specific focus on L&I Australia and Europe to remain above <strong>+30%</strong>), <strong>occupancy rates</strong> for both L&I (expecting ><strong>96%</strong>) and Commercial (monitoring improvement at ATP to ><strong>80%</strong>), and the <strong>average cost of debt</strong> to ensure it stabilizes or declines as interest rates normalize. Additionally, we will closely monitor the execution of the <strong>357 Collins Street divestment</strong> and the subsequent debt reduction and deployment of capital into accretive opportunities. Further <strong>DPU guidance</strong> from management, particularly regarding the proportion of management fees paid in units versus cash (which significantly impacted 1HFY2025 DPU), will be a critical near-term signal. Any significant divergence from our projected <strong>FCF growth</strong> or unexpected increase in <strong>CapEx</strong> would trigger a re-evaluation. Competitive landscape shifts in key markets and macro indicators such as global trade volumes and interest rate expectations will also be integral to our tracking, ensuring timely adjustments to our conviction level.</p>
        
        <p><strong>CATALYST TIMELINE & EXIT STRATEGY</strong></p>
        <p>We anticipate a series of catalysts to drive FLCT's unit price towards our target by Q2 FY2026. <strong>Near-term (Q4 FY2025)</strong> catalysts include the successful completion of the <strong>357 Collins Street divestment</strong> by September 30, 2025, and clarity on its proceeds utilization, alongside strong 4QFY2025 rental reversion announcements. <strong>Mid-term (Q1-Q2 FY2026)</strong> catalysts are expected from 1HFY2026 earnings reports demonstrating sustained NPI growth and stabilizing <strong>DPU</strong> due to lower finance costs and accretive acquisitions. Further confirmation of global interest rate cuts by major central banks will significantly de-risk the investment and likely trigger broader S-REIT re-ratings. Our exit strategy involves reassessing the position if the unit price approaches <strong>S$1.30</strong> or if fundamental indicators consistently deteriorate, such as persistent negative rental reversions in the L&I segment, a substantial increase in the cost of debt above <strong>3.5%</strong>, or a significant rise in aggregate leverage beyond <strong>38%</strong> without corresponding accretive growth. We will also monitor any material shift in the global logistics market dynamics, although current trends remain favorable.</p>
