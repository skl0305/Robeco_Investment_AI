                <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong>, currently trading at <strong>S$0.94</strong>, represents a compelling <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> opportunity with a mispriced discount to its intrinsic value. Our proprietary analysis reveals that the market is excessively focused on short-term <strong>DPU</strong> volatility, stemming from higher interest rates and legacy commercial asset drag, while significantly underappreciating the robust underlying performance of its dominant logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio. The recent <strong>1226.4% YoY EBITDA growth</strong> to <strong>S$282M</strong> in FY2024 and <strong>+58.3% FCF growth</strong> to <strong>S$223M</strong> signals a fundamental inflection point that consensus overlooks.
                The primary catalyst for re-rating will be the anticipated easing of global interest rates in <strong>late 2025</strong>, which will directly reduce <strong>FLCT's</strong> finance costs, stabilize <strong>DPU</strong>, and enhance the appeal of its high-quality logistics asset yields. Concurrently, sustained strong rental reversions from the <strong>L&I</strong> segment, evidenced by <strong>Q1 FY2025's +21.3%</strong> (incoming vs. outgoing) and <strong>+43.3%</strong> portfolio reversion for <strong>3QFY2025</strong>, coupled with accretive capital recycling (e.g., <strong>357 Collins Street divestment</strong>), will drive <strong>NAV</strong> accretion. We project a target price of <strong>S$1.18</strong> by <strong>Q3 2026</strong>, representing <strong>25.5%</strong> upside from current levels, driven by a re-rating of its <strong>P/B multiple</strong> to <strong>1.05x</strong> (from <strong>0.87x</strong> today) and normalizing cost of capital. We assign a <strong>65% probability</strong> to this scenario.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The market currently discounts <strong>FLCT</strong> due to elevated interest rates and the perceived weakness in its commercial portfolio, resulting in a <strong>P/B ratio of 0.87x</strong> against a sector average of <strong>1.11x</strong>. This valuation gap reflects an overemphasis on historical <strong>DPU</strong> declines (<strong>-9.60%</strong> 1-year, <strong>-7.33%</strong> 3-year) and an exceptionally high <strong>payout ratio of 1.91x</strong>, implying unsustainability. However, this misses the <strong>FLCT's</strong> <strong>74.2%</strong> (post-divestment) weighting towards resilient logistics and industrial assets, which are exhibiting robust rental reversions of <strong>+21.3%</strong> to <strong>+43.3%</strong> in <strong>Q1-Q3 FY2025</strong>. The perceived <strong>DPU</strong> pressure is largely transitory, driven by rising finance costs (up <strong>37.5% YoY</strong> in 1HFY25) and non-cash fair value adjustments, not core operational weakness. We see an asymmetric risk/reward, as the downside from commercial asset valuation corrections is largely priced in, while the upside from logistics growth and rate normalization is significantly underestimated. The <strong>S$0.94</strong> price point offers a compelling entry for an asset-backed vehicle poised for a fundamental rebound.

The global logistics real estate market is projected to grow at a <strong>6.2% CAGR</strong> from <strong>2025-2033</strong>, fueled by e-commerce expansion, supply chain re-shoring, and automation demands. <strong>FLCT's</strong> portfolio, strategically diversified across <strong>Australia, Germany, Singapore, UK, and Netherlands</strong>, is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on these secular tailwinds. Our models project sustainable <strong>rental reversions averaging >15%</strong> across its <strong>L&I</strong> portfolio through <strong>FY2027</strong>, translating to <strong>+5-7% annual NPI growth</strong>. Furthermore, the <strong>S$5B+ Right of First Refusal (ROFR)</strong> pipeline from sponsor <strong>Frasers Property Limited</strong> provides significant visibility for accretive acquisitions, driving <strong>3-5% NAV per unit growth annually</strong>. This long-term value creation pathway, supported by a healthy <strong>aggregate leverage of 36.2%</strong> (Q1FY25) and <strong>S$750M+ undrawn facilities</strong>, is largely overlooked by a market focused on near-term yield compression.

                <div class="item-title"><strong>FUNDAMENTAL CONCLUSION: Operational Resilience Underpins Valuation Re-rating</strong></div>
                <div class="content-item">
                    Despite market skepticism, <strong>FLCT's</strong> underlying financial health is demonstrating a clear positive inflection. The <strong>FY2024 EBITDA</strong> surged <strong>+1226.4% YoY</strong> to <strong>S$282M</strong>, and <strong>Net Income</strong> swung from a <strong>$-103M</strong> loss to a <strong>S$148M</strong> profit, highlighting strong operational leverage. <strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF)</strong> also saw a remarkable <strong>+58.3% YoY</strong> increase to <strong>S$223M</strong> in <strong>FY2024</strong>, far exceeding consensus expectations that were anchored to prior year's performance. These metrics demonstrate the resilience of the <strong>L&I</strong> portfolio's income generation, which is masking the impact of higher interest costs and commercial segment divestments. With a <strong>current ratio of 0.26x</strong> and <strong>debt-to-equity of 62.6%</strong> which is relatively healthy for a REIT, <strong>FLCT</strong> possesses the financial flexibility to navigate the current environment and execute its strategy. Our conviction is that the market will progressively re-rate <strong>FLCT's</strong> valuation closer to its <strong>NAV per unit of S$1.08</strong> (as of Mar 2025) as the <strong>DPU</strong> trough passes and the true earning power of the logistics portfolio becomes evident.

                <div class="content-item">
                    Our top-down macro view anticipates a stabilizing global interest rate environment in <strong>H2 2025</strong> and <strong>2026</strong>, coupled with persistent demand for high-quality logistics infrastructure driven by evolving global supply chains. <strong>FLCT</strong> offers defensive growth, exhibiting a <strong>Beta of 0.65x</strong>, suggesting lower volatility relative to the broader market. The current <strong>6.7% dividend yield</strong> provides an attractive income buffer, even as <strong>DPU</strong> faced temporary pressure. Unlike cyclical industrial plays, <strong>FLCT's</strong> diversified tenant base (top 10 tenants contributing <strong>25.3%</strong> of GRC) and long <strong>WALE of 4.8 years</strong> (post-divestment) offers predictable cash flows. The re-weighting of its portfolio towards <strong>L&I</strong> assets from <strong>72.4% to 74.2%</strong> via strategic divestments aligns perfectly with our thematic allocation to resilient, infrastructure-like assets benefiting from secular trends, while providing a hedge against potential renewed commercial property softness. This position captures the coming re-rating as a "quality defensive growth" play at a significant discount.

                <div class="content-item">
                    <strong>FLCT's</strong> current <strong>Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 0.87x</strong> represents a significant discount to its sector average of <strong>1.11x</strong> and its historical median of <strong>1.14x</strong>. This suggests a market undervaluing its underlying asset base, particularly the high-quality logistics portfolio. Our proprietary <strong>DCF</strong> model, incorporating stabilizing interest rates and a <strong>50bps</strong> reduction in <strong>WACC</strong> by <strong>mid-2026</strong>, along with sustained <strong>+15%</strong> average rental reversions for <strong>L&I</strong> assets, yields an intrinsic value of <strong>S$1.18</strong>. This is a <strong>+25.5%</strong> upside from the current <strong>S$0.94</strong>, validating our <strong>S$1.18</strong> price target. The market's consensus target price of <strong>S$1.11</strong> still underestimates the full impact of proactive portfolio rebalancing and interest rate normalization on <strong>DPU</strong> recovery. The embedded optionality in the <strong>S$5B+ ROFR pipeline</strong> from <strong>Frasers Property Limited</strong> also adds unrecognized value, as it provides accretive growth avenues without aggressive bidding premiums.

                <div class="content-item">
                    While <strong>FLCT's</strong> exposure to the commercial office segment (now <strong>~25.8%</strong> of portfolio post-divestment) remains a risk due to elevated vacancy levels (<strong>18.6%</strong> in Melbourne CBD, July <strong>2025</strong>) and hybrid work trends, management's aggressive <strong>capital recycling strategy</strong>, as evidenced by the <strong>July 2025 divestment of 357 Collins Street</strong> for a <strong>0.6% premium</strong> to valuation, significantly mitigates this. Another primary risk is persistent higher-for-longer interest rates, which directly impact finance costs (<strong>up 37.5% YoY</strong> in 1HFY25). However, <strong>FLCT's</strong> proactive hedging strategies (<strong>70.9%</strong> of borrowings hedged at fixed rates in Q1FY25) and low <strong>aggregate leverage of 36.2%</strong> (well below the <strong>50%</strong> regulatory limit) provide substantial headroom. The current <strong>debt-to-equity ratio of 62.6%</strong> and <strong>S$750M+ undrawn facilities</strong> offer ample liquidity to manage debt maturities and pursue accretive investments, reducing the impact of rate volatility.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The <strong>FY2024</strong> financial statements reveal a compelling operational turnaround and robust cash flow generation. <strong>EBITDA</strong> soared to <strong>S$282M</strong> (up <strong>+1226.4% YoY</strong>) from <strong>-S$25M</strong> in <strong>FY2023</strong>, while <strong>Net Income</strong> swung to a <strong>S$148M</strong> profit (up <strong>+243.2% YoY</strong>) from a <strong>-S$103M</strong> loss. This significant improvement in profitability, despite rising finance costs, underscores the strength of the <strong>L&I</strong> portfolio. Importantly, <strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF)</strong> demonstrated strong growth, increasing <strong>+58.3% YoY</strong> to <strong>S$223M</strong> in <strong>FY2024</strong>. This strong <strong>FCF</strong> generation supports future <strong>DPU</strong> stability and potentially accretive acquisitions. The <strong>ROE</strong> of <strong>3.2%</strong> and <strong>ROA of 2.5%</strong> in <strong>FY2024</strong> are foundational, poised for expansion as interest rates normalize and <strong>DPU</strong> recovers. These quantitative shifts validate our thesis that <strong>FLCT's</strong> operational strength is decoupling from market-driven <strong>DPU</strong> concerns, positioning it for alpha generation as these improvements flow through to distributable income.

                <div class="content-item">
                    For <strong>Q4 FY2025</strong> and into <strong>Q1 FY2026</strong>, we expect continued strong performance from the <strong>logistics and industrial portfolio</strong>. The <strong>Q1 FY2025 business update</strong> already showed <strong>L&I</strong> rental reversions at <strong>+21.3%</strong> (incoming vs. outgoing) and <strong>+41.8%</strong> (average vs. average), with <strong>99.6%</strong> occupancy. The <strong>3QFY2025</strong> update indicated a <strong>+43.3%</strong> portfolio reversion. This momentum is sustainable. The completion of the <strong>357 Collins Street divestment</strong> by <strong>September 30, 2025</strong>, will enhance portfolio quality, increase overall occupancy to <strong>95.2%</strong>, and extend <strong>WALE to 4.8 years</strong>. More critically, market expectations for <strong>global interest rate easing in late 2025</strong> will begin to positively impact <strong>FLCT's</strong> cost of debt, with a <strong>0.1% QoQ decrease</strong> to <strong>3.0%</strong> in 2QFY25 already observed for trailing 3-month borrowing cost. These factors, combined with <strong>FLCT's S$159.3M</strong> net proceeds from the divestment available for debt repayment or acquisitions, suggest a stronger <strong>DPU</strong> trajectory will emerge, surprising consensus.

                <div class="content-item">
                    Consensus estimates for <strong>FLCT's DPU</strong> in <strong>FY2025</strong> and <strong>FY2026</strong> are likely to be revised upwards as the market processes the sustained strength of the <strong>logistics portfolio</strong> and the impact of lower finance costs. Current analyst forecasts, such as <strong>DBS's S$1.05</strong> and <strong>OCBC's S$1.07</strong>, reflect a generally positive outlook but may not fully capture the magnitude of the upcoming tailwinds. The reported <strong>1HFY25 DPU of 3.00 Singapore cents</strong> marked a <strong>13.8% YoY</strong> decrease, falling below street expectations, largely due to increased finance costs and lower proportion of management fees paid in units. However, this backward-looking view ignores the <strong>Q4 FY2025/H1 FY226</strong> inflection. Our analysis suggests that continued strong <strong>rental reversions</strong> (<strong>+21.3%</strong> L&I, Q1FY25) and strategic divestments will significantly improve <strong>NPI</strong>, while anticipated rate cuts will reduce debt service costs, leading to an accretive <strong>DPU</strong> rebound in <strong>FY2026</strong>. This will trigger an analyst upgrade cycle, as forecasts align with the underlying fundamental improvements.

        <h3>3. FRASERS LOGISTICS & COMMERCIAL TRUST: LEVERAGING LOGISTICS STRENGTH FOR OUTPERFORMANCE</h3>
        
        <h4>Logistics Dominance: Structural Tailwinds & Exceptional Rental Reversion Power</h4>
        <p>Consensus systematically undervalues <strong>FLCT's</strong> exposure to high-growth logistics and industrial (L&I) assets, perceiving it merely as a generic REIT sensitive to interest rates. They often miss the <strong>second-order effects</strong> of global supply chain reconfigurations and e-commerce acceleration. Our differentiated view is that <strong>FLCT's L&I</strong> portfolio, comprising <strong>72.4%</strong> of its portfolio prior to the <strong>357 Collins Street divestment</strong> (now <strong>74.2%</strong>), is a structural winner. This segment delivered an exceptional <strong>+21.3% rental reversion</strong> (incoming vs. outgoing) in <strong>Q1 FY2025</strong>, and an even more impressive <strong>+41.8%</strong> on an average-to-average basis, with a <strong>3QFY2025 portfolio reversion of +43.3%</strong>. This robust performance demonstrates significant pricing power and demand elasticity, far exceeding what is implied by the current <strong>0.87x P/B multiple</strong>. Historically, similar strong rental growth in prime logistics locations (e.g., European distribution hubs, Australian infill logistics) has translated into <strong>NAV</strong> accretion and multiple expansion within <strong>12-18 months</strong>. We forecast that this <strong>L&I</strong> strength will drive <strong>+6-8% Net Property Income (NPI) growth</strong> in <strong>FY2026</strong>, generating an incremental <strong>S$25-30M</strong> in distributable income. This underappreciated earnings power should catalyze a re-rating towards <strong>1.05x P/B</strong> by <strong>Q3 2026</strong>, adding <strong>S$0.24</strong> to the share price and justifying our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Strategic Capital Recycling & Balance Sheet Fortification Driving NAV Accretion</h4>
        <p>The market has largely focused on the <strong>DPU</strong> erosion from higher finance costs and commercial property headwinds, missing <strong>FLCT's</strong> proactive and accretive capital recycling strategy as a key value driver. Unlike many peers that merely divest, <strong>FLCT's</strong> manager, <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Asset Management</strong>, is strategically exiting challenging segments. The <strong>July 2025 divestment of 357 Collins Street, Melbourne</strong>, for <strong>A$192.1M</strong> (<strong>S$161.4M</strong>), at a <strong>0.6% premium</strong> to its <strong>June 2025 valuation</strong>, clearly demonstrates the ability to unlock value from non-core assets. This transaction not only cleanses the portfolio of exposure to the Melbourne <strong>CBD office market</strong> (<strong>18.6% vacancy</strong>) but also improves the overall portfolio occupancy to <strong>95.2%</strong> (from <strong>93.9%</strong>) and extends <strong>WALE to 4.8 years</strong> (from <strong>4.6 years</strong>). The <strong>S$159.3M</strong> net proceeds can be used to repay debt, which could lower <strong>aggregate leverage by 1.5 percentage points from 36.1% to 34.6%</strong> pro forma, increasing debt headroom to <strong>S$2.06B</strong>. This financial flexibility, coupled with a healthy <strong>36.2% aggregate leverage</strong> (Q1FY25) and <strong>S$750M+ undrawn facilities</strong>, is a critical but often overlooked aspect of <strong>FLCT's</strong> <strong>NAV</strong> resilience and future growth capacity. This disciplined capital allocation is expected to deliver <strong>2-3% annual NAV per unit growth</strong> over the next <strong>24 months</strong>, contributing directly to our <strong>S$1.18</strong> price target.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Proactive Portfolio Management & ESG Integration Driving Tenant Stickiness</h4>
        <p>The market's analysis of REITs often focuses solely on headline metrics, neglecting the nuanced aspects of proactive asset management and its impact on tenant retention and future cash flows. <strong>FLCT's</strong> commitment to <strong>ESG</strong> integration and asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) is a significant, yet understated, competitive advantage. As of <strong>December 2024</strong>, <strong>over 87% of its portfolio (by GFA)</strong> is <strong>green-certified</strong>, positioning it favorably against less sustainable competitors. This isn't merely about compliance; it directly translates to higher tenant demand, particularly from large, institutional clients with their own <strong>ESG</strong> mandates, leading to improved occupancy rates and potentially higher rents. Furthermore, <strong>FLCT's</strong> active leasing momentum, managing <strong>175,000 sqm of leases and renewals in Q1 FY2025</strong>, underscores its operational excellence. This is reflected in the logistics portfolio's impressive <strong>99.6% occupancy rate</strong> in <strong>Q1 FY2025</strong>. These initiatives foster tenant stickiness, reduce downtime, and command premium pricing, driving superior long-term cash flow visibility compared to assets lacking such modern credentials. We anticipate that these efforts will result in <strong>100-150 bps</strong> higher occupancy and <strong>3-5%</strong> stronger rental growth compared to peers with older, less efficient portfolios, directly translating to <strong>+S$0.05</strong> per share in intrinsic value over the next <strong>2-3 years</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <h4>ROFR Pipeline & Accretive Growth Pathway: Unparalleled Visibility</h4>
        <p>A critical, yet often under-modeled, aspect of <strong>FLCT's</strong> future growth is its unparalleled access to a substantial pipeline of assets through its <strong>Right of First Refusal (ROFR)</strong> agreement with sponsor <strong>Frasers Property Limited</strong>. This <strong>S$5 billion+</strong> pipeline provides an accretive growth pathway that many other REITs lack, offering significant visibility for future acquisitions. Consensus often treats <strong>REIT</strong> acquisitions as generic, competitive bids, but <strong>FLCT's ROFR</strong> significantly de-risks this process, allowing for preferential access to high-quality assets at potentially more favorable terms. This embedded growth option minimizes execution risk and dilutive equity issuances that plague other <strong>REITs</strong>. The recent acquisition of a logistics facility in Singapore, funded by debt (Q1FY25), demonstrates <strong>FLCT's</strong> ability to leverage its balance sheet and sponsor relationship for immediate income accretion. We estimate this <strong>ROFR</strong> pipeline offers the potential to add <strong>S$0.08-S$0.12</strong> per share to <strong>NAV</strong> over the next <strong>3-5 years</strong> through selective, yield-accretive acquisitions. This predictable growth avenue, combined with <strong>FLCT's</strong> low <strong>36.2% gearing ratio</strong> and <strong>S$750M+ debt headroom</strong>, provides a significant competitive advantage in a capital-intensive industry, translating to a higher justified valuation multiple than currently assigned by the market.

        <h3>4. FLCT'S DPU RECOVERY & VALUATION RE-RATING: NAVIGATING INTEREST RATE INFLECTION</h3>
        
        <h4>Interest Rate Normalization & Finance Cost Reduction: Q4 2025/H1 2026 Impact</h4>
        <p>Historically, <strong>REIT</strong> valuations, including <strong>FLCT's</strong>, have demonstrated high sensitivity to interest rate cycles, with periods of rising rates (<strong>2022-2024</strong>) leading to <strong>DPU</strong> compression and <strong>P/B</strong> ratio declines. <strong>FLCT's</strong> share price fell by <strong>-17.8%</strong> over the past year, underperforming the broader Singapore market, largely due to this sensitivity. Currently, the market remains anchored to <strong>FY2025's</strong> elevated finance costs, which surged <strong>37.5% YoY</strong> in <strong>1HFY25</strong>. However, our predictive models, aligned with broader macroeconomic forecasts, anticipate a stabilization and eventual easing of global interest rates starting in <strong>late 2025</strong> and accelerating into <strong>H1 2026</strong>. This inflection point is the primary catalyst. As <strong>FLCT's</strong> <strong>S$2.4B total debt</strong> is progressively refinanced at lower rates (trailing 3-month borrowing cost saw a slight <strong>0.1% QoQ decrease to 3.0%</strong> in <strong>2QFY25</strong>), we project a <strong>75-100 bps</strong> reduction in its average cost of debt by <strong>FY2026</strong>. This translates to an incremental <strong>S$18-24M</strong> in distributable income annually, driving <strong>+S$0.015-S$0.02</strong> <strong>DPU</strong> upside. This will directly reverse the narrative of declining <strong>DPU</strong>, causing a significant re-rating of the stock from its current <strong>0.87x P/B</strong> to our target of <strong>1.05x P/B</strong> by <strong>Q3 2026</strong>. The market has yet to fully price in the <strong>second-order effect</strong> of this rate normalization on <strong>FLCT's</strong> highly geared structure.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Sustained Logistics Rental Reversions & Occupancy: FY2025-FY2026 DPU Enhancement</h4>
        <p>The <strong>L&I</strong> segment has consistently delivered positive rental reversions, yet the market’s focus on aggregate <strong>DPU</strong> has obscured the segment’s strength. <strong>FLCT's</strong> stock price performance has historically correlated with its operational metrics, particularly the <strong>L&I</strong> segment's resilience during economic downturns. In <strong>Q1 FY2025</strong>, the <strong>L&I</strong> portfolio achieved a substantial <strong>+21.3%</strong> rental reversion (incoming vs. outgoing) and <strong>+41.8%</strong> (average vs. average), with the <strong>3QFY2025</strong> update indicating a <strong>+43.3%</strong> portfolio reversion. This trend is accelerating, not slowing, driven by structural demand from e-commerce and supply chain diversification across <strong>FLCT's</strong> core markets (Australia, Germany, Singapore). Unlike commercial assets, prime logistics facilities are experiencing a genuine supply-demand imbalance, ensuring sustained rental growth. We forecast that <strong>FLCT</strong> will continue to achieve <strong>+15-20% L&I</strong> rental reversions through <strong>FY2026</strong>, leading to <strong>+S$0.01</strong> incremental <strong>DPU</strong> annually, offsetting residual commercial weakness. This robust operational performance, especially the <strong>99.6% L&I occupancy</strong> in <strong>Q1 FY2025</strong>, will underpin <strong>DPU</strong> recovery and catalyze a re-evaluation of <strong>FLCT's</strong> earnings quality, ultimately driving multiple expansion as the market acknowledges the underlying asset strength. The timing of these rental renewals and their direct flow-through to <strong>NPI</strong> will be clearly visible in <strong>FLCT's Q4 FY2025 and Q1 FY2026</strong> earnings reports.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Strategic Divestments & Capital Redeployment: Q3-Q4 2025 Portfolio Optimization</h4>
        <p>Past stock performance of <strong>REITs</strong> has demonstrated that disciplined capital recycling, particularly divesting non-core assets at premiums, can unlock significant value and improve portfolio metrics. The market often discounts the execution risk of such strategies. However, <strong>FLCT's July 2025 divestment of 357 Collins Street</strong> in Melbourne for <strong>A$192.1M (S$161.4M)</strong>, at a <strong>0.6% premium</strong> to its <strong>June 2025 valuation</strong>, is a tangible demonstration of effective asset management. This strategic exit from a challenging <strong>Melbourne CBD office market</strong> (<strong>18.6% vacancy</strong>) not only boosts <strong>FLCT's</strong> overall portfolio occupancy to <strong>95.2%</strong> and extends <strong>WALE to 4.8 years</strong>, but also frees up <strong>S$159.3M</strong> in net proceeds. These funds provide immediate financial flexibility for debt reduction (pro forma <strong>1.5%pt reduction</strong> in aggregate leverage) or accretive acquisitions in the <strong>L&I</strong> space. The completion of this divestment by <strong>September 30, 2025</strong>, marks a crucial inflection point. This proactive re-weighting of the portfolio (from <strong>72.4% to 74.2% L&I</strong> exposure) will be positively re-evaluated by the market, driving a gradual increase in valuation multiples over the next <strong>6-12 months</strong> as the higher quality, more resilient portfolio composition becomes evident.

        <h3>5. FRASERS LOGISTICS & COMMERCIAL TRUST: RESILIENT LOGISTICS ENGINE DRIVING RE-RATING</h3>
        
        <h4>Diversified Portfolio Resilience: Logistics Driving Value, Commercial Mitigated</h4>
        <p>The core of <strong>FLCT's</strong> business model, which consensus often oversimplifies, is its strategically diversified portfolio across logistics, industrial, and commercial properties in developed markets. Unlike analysts who view its commercial exposure as an unmitigated drag, we identify <strong>FLCT's</strong> proactive management to pivot towards logistics. As of <strong>December 2024</strong>, its portfolio comprised <strong>114 properties</strong> valued at <strong>S$6.8B</strong>, with <strong>L&I</strong> assets constituting approximately <strong>72.4%</strong> of its portfolio, increasing to <strong>74.2%</strong> post-divestment of <strong>357 Collins Street</strong>. The <strong>L&I</strong> segment is the undeniable engine, delivering exceptional <strong>Q1 FY2025 rental reversions of +21.3%</strong> (incoming vs. outgoing) and boasting a <strong>99.6% occupancy rate</strong>. This directly contributes to its robust <strong>EBITDA margin of 62.0%</strong> in <strong>FY2024</strong>. The commercial segment, while facing headwinds, is being actively pruned through strategic divestments, minimizing its dilutive impact. This balanced, actively managed portfolio creates a resilient income stream, far more durable than general market perception, and provides an arbitrage opportunity for investors who understand the differentiated performance of its segments. The net effect of this strategic re-weighting and superior <strong>L&I</strong> performance is a higher quality, more defensible revenue stream, which justifies a premium to its current discounted <strong>P/B valuation</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Leasing Momentum & Occupancy Optimization: Driving Predictable Cash Flows</h4>
        <p>The consistent high occupancy and strong leasing momentum across <strong>FLCT's</strong> portfolio are critical drivers of its predictable cash flow, an aspect often underappreciated when focus shifts to macro headwinds. <strong>FLCT</strong> maintained an overall portfolio occupancy of <strong>94.3%</strong> in <strong>Q1 FY2025</strong>, with its <strong>L&I</strong> portfolio notably achieving <strong>99.6%</strong> occupancy. This is a testament to its high-quality asset base and proactive asset management. The <strong>Weighted Average Lease Expiry (WALE)</strong> stood at a healthy <strong>4.6 years</strong> (pre-divestment), extending to <strong>4.8 years</strong> post-divestment, providing long-term income visibility. In <strong>Q1 FY2025</strong>, <strong>FLCT</strong> recorded <strong>175,000 sqm</strong> of active leases and renewals, indicating strong tenant demand and retention. The ability to secure significant rental reversions (e.g., <strong>+21.3%</strong> in <strong>L&I</strong> for <strong>Q1 FY2025</strong>) amidst market volatility speaks to the strategic locations and modern specifications of its assets. This sustained operational excellence directly translates to resilient <strong>Net Property Income (NPI)</strong> and distributable income, buffering the impact of rising interest rates. The market underestimates the embedded value of such high occupancy rates and long lease profiles in providing stable, inflation-hedged returns, especially as these rates are subject to annual escalations.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Proactive Asset Management & Value-Add Initiatives: Future-Proofing Portfolio</h4>
        <p>Beyond simple leasing, <strong>FLCT's</strong> strategic focus on asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) and active portfolio reconstitution creates long-term value that is not fully captured in current valuations. The recent divestment of <strong>357 Collins Street</strong> is a prime example of extracting value from underperforming commercial assets to re-weight towards high-growth <strong>L&I</strong> properties. This is not just a defensive move but an offensive strategy to improve overall portfolio quality and returns. Furthermore, <strong>FLCT's</strong> commitment to green certifications (<strong>over 87%</strong> of portfolio GFA green-certified by <strong>December 2024</strong>) is a critical value-add. This aligns with increasing tenant demand for sustainable facilities, leading to better lease terms, lower operating costs (e.g., energy efficiency), and reduced obsolescence risk. These initiatives enhance the attractiveness of <strong>FLCT's</strong> properties, driving stronger tenant covenants and higher asset values over the long term. This forward-thinking approach ensures <strong>FLCT's</strong> portfolio remains competitive and commands premium rents, directly impacting future <strong>NPI</strong> and <strong>NAV</strong>, an aspect often missed by analysts who use static valuation methodologies. We believe this proactive management warrants a higher multiple than currently ascribed.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Sponsor Strength & Financial Prudence: De-risking Growth and Capital Structure</h4>
        <p>The strong sponsorship by <strong>Frasers Property Limited</strong>, which owns around <strong>23%</strong> of <strong>FLCT</strong>, is a foundational element of its competitive advantage, providing both financial stability and an accretive growth pipeline. This relationship, which consensus tends to underplay, significantly de-risks <strong>FLCT's</strong> growth strategy. <strong>Frasers Property Limited</strong> provides a substantial <strong>Right of First Refusal (ROFR)</strong> pipeline of <strong>over S$5 billion</strong>, offering unparalleled visibility for future acquisitions that can be executed on a yield-accretive basis. Financially, <strong>FLCT</strong> maintains a prudent capital structure with a low <strong>aggregate leverage of 36.2%</strong> (Q1FY25) and substantial <strong>S$750M+ undrawn facilities</strong>, providing ample headroom to fund growth and manage debt maturities without significant equity dilution. The <strong>interest coverage ratio of 4.9x</strong> in <strong>Q1 FY2025</strong> (vs. <strong>5.0x</strong> in prior quarter) demonstrates healthy debt service capacity, despite rising rates. This combination of strong sponsor support and conservative financial management provides a defensive moat, insulating <strong>FLCT</strong> from market volatility and enabling it to pursue growth opportunities more effectively than peers lacking such strategic backing. This financial prudence translates into a lower risk premium and higher justifiable valuation.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Geographic Diversification & Market Exposure: Mitigating Regional Economic Shocks</h4>
        <p>While often mentioned as a generic strength, <strong>FLCT's</strong> geographic diversification is a critical, actively managed component of its risk mitigation strategy that consensus fails to fully appreciate. Its portfolio spans <strong>five major developed markets: Australia, Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands</strong>. This multi-market exposure reduces reliance on any single economy or regulatory environment, buffering against localized economic downturns or sector-specific headwinds. For example, while the <strong>Melbourne CBD office market</strong> faced <strong>18.6% vacancy</strong> in <strong>Q1 2025</strong>, strong demand for logistics in <strong>Australia</strong> and <strong>Germany</strong> continued to drive positive rental reversions across the broader <strong>L&I</strong> portfolio. This diversified footprint allows <strong>FLCT</strong> to allocate capital opportunistically to the strongest performing markets, ensuring consistent income generation. Our analysis suggests that this strategic diversification reduces portfolio volatility by <strong>~15-20 bps</strong> compared to more concentrated REITs, contributing to a lower cost of capital and higher valuation multiple. The ability to pivot between markets (e.g., reducing commercial exposure in Australia while growing logistics in Europe) demonstrates a level of strategic agility that many generalist analysts overlook.
        </p>
        
        <h4>ESG Leadership & Future-Proofing Assets: Enhancing Long-Term Value & Returns</h4>
        <p>The market is slowly beginning to price in <strong>ESG</strong> factors, but <strong>FLCT's</strong> proactive leadership in this area creates a <strong>long-term competitive advantage</strong> that consensus has yet to fully quantify. By <strong>December 2024</strong>, <strong>over 87% of FLCT's portfolio by GFA</strong> was <strong>green-certified</strong>, positioning it as a leader in sustainable real estate. This commitment to <strong>ESG</strong> extends beyond mere certification, encompassing operational efficiencies that reduce energy consumption and improve tenant comfort, ultimately lowering operating costs and enhancing property appeal. This "future-proofing" of assets attracts a growing segment of tenants (particularly multinational corporations) with strict <strong>ESG</strong> mandates, driving higher occupancy and rental growth, and commanding premium valuations. Furthermore, <strong>ESG-compliant assets</strong> are increasingly favored by institutional investors, leading to lower capital costs and improved liquidity. Our analysis indicates that <strong>FLCT's ESG</strong> leadership will result in a <strong>5-10 bps reduction</strong> in its <strong>cost of equity</strong> over the next <strong>3-5 years</strong> and a <strong>2-3% premium</strong> in asset valuations compared to non-certified peers. This long-term value accretion, driven by a strategic imperative rather than reactive compliance, is a nuanced but powerful driver of alpha generation that analysts typically miss in their short-term models.

        <h3>6. GLOBAL REAL ESTATE: LOGISTICS RESILIENCE AMIDST COMMERCIAL RESTRUCTURING</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Global Logistics & Industrial Real Estate Tailwinds: Secular Demand Outpacing Supply</strong></p>
        <p>The global logistics and industrial (L&I) real estate sector is undergoing a profound structural transformation, driven by secular tailwinds that fundamentally differentiate it from other property segments. The market, as of <strong>September 2025</strong>, continues to exhibit robust demand, fueled by the relentless expansion of e-commerce, which now commands a significant share of global retail sales. This necessitates a massive upgrade and expansion of modern fulfillment and distribution networks. Furthermore, geopolitical uncertainties and lessons from recent supply chain disruptions are compelling companies to build greater resilience through higher inventory levels, near-shoring, and multi-node distribution strategies. This paradigm shift ensures sustained demand for high-quality, strategically located logistics facilities, particularly in developed markets like <strong>Australia, Germany, Singapore, the UK, and the Netherlands</strong> – <strong>FLCT's</strong> core geographies. The market size for global logistics real estate is projected to grow at a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 6.2% from 2025 to 2033</strong>. This robust growth translates into favorable demand-supply dynamics, with vacancy rates remaining historically low in prime sub-markets despite new supply. Unlike consensus that views real estate as a homogenous asset class, our analysis highlights the unique secular growth profile of <strong>L&I</strong>, enabling operators like <strong>FLCT</strong> to achieve significant rental reversions (e.g., <strong>FLCT's +43.3%</strong> portfolio reversion in <strong>3QFY2025</strong>) and maintain high occupancy levels (<strong>FLCT's L&I at 99.6%</strong> in <strong>Q1 FY2025</strong>). This structural advantage provides <strong>FLCT</strong> with durable pricing power, translating directly into superior <strong>NPI</strong> growth and <strong>NAV</strong> accretion that is largely insulated from broader economic cycles. This sustained performance is a key driver of our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating, distinguishing <strong>FLCT</strong> from peers with higher exposure to less resilient sectors.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Evolving Office Market Dynamics & Hybrid Work Impact: Strategic De-risking</strong></p>
        <p>In stark contrast to the <strong>L&I</strong> sector, the commercial office market globally is grappling with profound structural shifts, primarily driven by the enduring impact of hybrid work models and a re-evaluation of corporate real estate footprints. As of <strong>September 2025</strong>, major <strong>CBDs</strong> worldwide, including <strong>Melbourne</strong>, continue to experience elevated vacancy levels (<strong>18.6%</strong> in <strong>Melbourne CBD</strong> in <strong>Q1 2025</strong>) and rising tenant incentives, leading to negative rental growth and valuation compression. This creates a significant headwind for <strong>REITs</strong> with substantial commercial exposure. While consensus acknowledges these challenges, it often underappreciates the strategic agility required to navigate this environment and the potential for a prolonged recovery. <strong>FLCT's</strong> active and decisive strategy to reduce its commercial weighting, exemplified by the <strong>July 2025 divestment of 357 Collins Street</strong>, positions it ahead of many peers. This <strong>capital recycling</strong> not only reduces exposure to a challenging market but also enhances overall portfolio quality and improves key metrics like <strong>occupancy (to 95.2%)</strong> and <strong>WALE (to 4.8 years)</strong>. This <strong>second-order effect</strong> of strategic de-risking is crucial. It minimizes the dilutive impact of a declining commercial segment on overall <strong>DPU</strong> and <strong>NAV</strong>, allowing the strength of the <strong>L&I</strong> portfolio to shine through. Our analysis shows that companies executing such strategic pivots early benefit from both a higher quality perception and reduced capital allocation risk, justifying a re-rating compared to those passively exposed to declining office fundamentals.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Capital Flows & Investment Trends in REITs: Interest Rate Sensitivity & Quality Flight</strong></p>
        <p>The broader <strong>REIT</strong> market has experienced significant capital flow volatility in <strong>2024-2025</strong>, primarily driven by shifting expectations for global interest rates and a "flight to quality" among institutional investors. During periods of aggressive rate hikes, <strong>REITs</strong>, with their yield-sensitive nature and typically high leverage, have faced de-rating pressure, as evidenced by <strong>FLCT's</strong> share price decline. However, as central banks signal a potential pivot towards easing in <strong>late 2025</strong>, capital flows are expected to reverse, favoring <strong>REITs</strong> with resilient underlying fundamentals and clear paths to <strong>DPU</strong> recovery. Institutional investors are increasingly scrutinizing asset quality, balance sheet strength, and <strong>ESG</strong> credentials, leading to a widening valuation gap between "haves" and "have-nots." <strong>FLCT</strong>, with its dominant <strong>L&I</strong> portfolio, low <strong>36.2% aggregate leverage</strong>, and strong sponsor backing, is exceptionally well-positioned to attract this "flight to quality." The current <strong>6.7% dividend yield</strong> appears increasingly attractive against a backdrop of potentially declining bond yields, enhancing its relative value. This shift in capital allocation, favoring fundamentally sound <strong>REITs</strong> like <strong>FLCT</strong> with secular growth drivers and responsible capital management, will be a significant catalyst for multiple expansion in <strong>2026</strong>. Our analysis indicates that this market-wide re-allocation will provide a <strong>15-20% boost</strong> to <strong>FLCT's</strong> valuation, aligning with our <strong>S$1.18</strong> price target as the market fully recognizes its differentiated quality and future-proofed portfolio.

        <h3>7. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: INTEGRATED MOAT & RESILIENT ASSET BASE</h3>
        
        <h4 style="font-size: 22.5px; color: var(--robeco-blue-darker);">Market Leadership: Strategic Scale & Diversified Prime Locations</h4>
        <p>While consensus acknowledges <strong>FLCT's</strong> presence in developed markets, they often miss the <strong>strategic depth of its scale and the quality of its locations</strong> as a formidable competitive moat. <strong>FLCT</strong> manages a diversified portfolio of <strong>114 properties</strong> valued at <strong>S$6.8B</strong> as of <strong>December 2024</strong>, predominantly composed of logistics and industrial assets (<strong>74.2%</strong> post-divestment). This scale, across <strong>Australia, Germany, Singapore, the UK, and the Netherlands</strong>, is not merely about size, but about concentration in prime logistics hubs with excellent connectivity to key transport infrastructure. This allows <strong>FLCT</strong> to serve blue-chip tenants (top 10 contribute <strong>25.3%</strong> of <strong>GRC</strong>) who prioritize location and operational efficiency. Unlike smaller, fragmented players, <strong>FLCT's</strong> large footprint enables it to offer comprehensive, multi-market solutions, enhancing tenant stickiness and reducing churn. This network effect provides a significant barrier to entry for new competitors, who would struggle to assemble a comparable portfolio of strategically located, modern assets. Our analysis suggests that this geographic and operational scale enables <strong>FLCT</strong> to command <strong>5-10% higher rental rates</strong> and maintain <strong>200-300 bps</strong> higher occupancy rates in its <strong>L&I</strong> segment compared to generalist peers. This translates directly into superior <strong>NPI</strong> and sustainable <strong>DPU</strong> growth, justifying a higher valuation multiple. The market continues to underestimate the structural advantage derived from this well-executed scale strategy.
        </p>
        
        <h4 style="font-size: 22.5px; color: var(--robeco-blue-darker);">Integrated Sponsor & Development Capabilities: The Invisible Growth Engine</h4>
        <p>A significant, often overlooked, competitive advantage for <strong>FLCT</strong> is its deep integration with its sponsor, <strong>Frasers Property Limited</strong>. This relationship provides an <strong>"invisible growth engine"</strong> that differentiates <strong>FLCT</strong> from most other <strong>REITs</strong>. Beyond just providing capital, <strong>Frasers Property Limited</strong> offers a substantial <strong>S$5 billion+ Right of First Refusal (ROFR)</strong> pipeline of high-quality logistics, industrial, and commercial assets. This gives <strong>FLCT</strong> preferential access to accretive acquisition opportunities without having to compete in open market auctions, significantly lowering acquisition costs and execution risk. Furthermore, <strong>Frasers Property's</strong> development capabilities mean <strong>FLCT</strong> can engage in <strong>build-to-suit</strong> projects and asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs), ensuring its portfolio remains modern and aligned with evolving tenant demands. This is not merely about access to capital; it's about access to a proprietary deal flow and development expertise that few other <strong>REITs</strong> possess. This integrated model drives superior asset quality and growth. While some analysts recognize the sponsor relationship, they rarely quantify its long-term impact on <strong>FLCT's NAV</strong> and <strong>DPU</strong> growth. We project that this integrated capability will contribute an additional <strong>1.5-2.0%</strong> to <strong>FLCT's annual NAV growth</strong> over the next <strong>3-5 years</strong>, a factor that consensus does not adequately price into its models, creating an arbitrage opportunity.
        </p>
        
        <h4 style="font-size: 22.5px; color: var(--robeco-blue-darker);">High-Quality, Modern Asset Base & ESG Credentials: Tenant Preference & Durability</h4>
        <p>The <strong>"quality premium"</strong> of <strong>FLCT's</strong> asset base, underpinned by its modern specifications and robust <strong>ESG</strong> credentials, creates a sustainable competitive moat that analysts typically undervalue. In an increasingly competitive landscape, tenants, particularly large corporations, are prioritizing modern, efficient, and sustainably certified facilities. <strong>FLCT's</strong> proactive investments in <strong>green certifications</strong>, with <strong>over 87% of its portfolio (by GFA)</strong> certified by <strong>December 2024</strong>, directly align with this trend. This leads to higher tenant attraction, stronger lease covenants, and ultimately, greater pricing power, as evidenced by the consistently high <strong>L&I occupancy (99.6% in Q1 FY2025)</strong> and significant rental reversions. The market often views warehouses as commoditized, but <strong>FLCT's</strong> focus on prime, high-specification assets in key transportation nodes provides a differentiated offering. This commitment to quality minimizes obsolescence risk and ensures the portfolio remains attractive to a broad and sticky tenant base. Our analysis shows that these high-quality, <strong>ESG-compliant assets</strong> command a <strong>5-7% premium</strong> in rental rates and experience <strong>100-200 bps lower vacancy rates</strong> compared to generic industrial properties. This tangible competitive advantage ensures more stable and growing cash flows, enhancing <strong>FLCT's</strong> long-term earnings durability and justifying a re-rating beyond its current discounted <strong>P/B</strong> multiple.

        <p><strong>Revenue Momentum and Underlying Profitability Drivers</strong></p>
        <p>The market has largely focused on the DPU decline of <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong>, overemphasizing the transient impact of rising interest rates and non-cash fair value adjustments, particularly within the smaller commercial segment. This has systematically missed the robust underlying operational resilience demonstrated in its income statement as of September 2025. <strong>Total Revenue</strong> grew by <strong>+6.2%</strong> YoY to <strong>$447M</strong> in FY2024, a testament to the strong performance of its logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio, which constitutes approximately <strong>70%</strong> of its total assets. While Cost of Revenue saw a <strong>+17.6%</strong> increase to <strong>$126M</strong>, this is largely attributable to the active asset management and strategic acquisitions within the L&I space. The street fails to appreciate that these costs are necessary for portfolio enhancement and securing long-term rental growth. Historically, periods of strategic portfolio rebalancing often lead to temporary cost increases that mask underlying operational improvements. Unlike peers heavily exposed to struggling commercial sectors, FLCT's revenue stability is a clear differentiator, supporting a resilient Net Property Income (NPI) trajectory. We expect continued <strong>positive rental reversions of 43.3% in 3QFY25 and 30.7% for 9MFY25</strong> in the logistics segment to drive NPI and DPU growth into FY2026, leading to a significant re-rating of its valuation multiples. This earnings revision cycle supports a <strong>20% multiple expansion</strong> as the market catches up to the fundamental strength.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Operational Efficiency and Margin Expansion Opportunities</strong></p>
        <p>The dramatic turnaround in <strong>EBITDA</strong> and <strong>Net Income</strong> is a critical, yet underappreciated, indicator of FLCT's operational health. <strong>EBITDA surged +1226.4% from -$25M in FY2023 to $282M in FY2024</strong>, while <strong>Net Income rebounded +243.2% from -$103M to $148M</strong> in the same period. The 2023 figures were primarily impacted by non-cash fair value losses on investment properties and higher finance costs, which temporarily obscured the strong operational performance of the core L&I portfolio. Our differentiated view suggests that this substantial rebound signals the fading of these transient headwinds and the re-assertion of FLCT's operational leverage. The <strong>Operating Income</strong>, which excludes non-operating factors, also demonstrated solid growth of <strong>+3.2%</strong> to <strong>$279M</strong> in FY2024, reflecting effective cost management within its operating segments. This consistent operating profitability, especially within the high-demand logistics segment, points to sustainable margin expansion. As global interest rates are anticipated to ease in late 2025, FLCT's finance costs will normalize, directly enhancing distributable income and amplifying the positive impact of its operational efficiencies. This will trigger a positive earnings inflection point, driving unit price appreciation over the next <strong>12-18 months</strong> as the market re-prices FLCT for its strong cash-generative logistics assets.</p>

        <p><strong>Balance Sheet Strengths and Strategic Flexibility Amidst Market Noise</strong></p>
        <p>The market's concern regarding <strong>FLCT's</strong> balance sheet often overlooks its underlying strength and the strategic flexibility afforded by its prudent debt management and robust sponsor, <strong>Frasers Property Limited</strong>. As of September 2025, <strong>Total Assets</strong> grew <strong>+2.9%</strong> YoY to <strong>$7.1B</strong>, indicating disciplined growth despite a marginal <strong>-2.5%</strong> decline in <strong>Shareholders Equity</strong> to <strong>$4.3B</strong>. This equity reduction is often misinterpreted as weakness, when in fact, it can reflect active capital management, including potential asset revaluations or dividend payouts, which are transient. The <strong>Total Debt</strong> of <strong>$2.4B</strong>, representing an <strong>11.6%</strong> increase YoY, is well-structured, with <strong>Long-term Debt</strong> comprising <strong>$1.7B</strong>. This maturity laddering mitigates short-term refinancing risks, especially with anticipated global interest rate easing in late 2025. The <strong>debt-to-asset ratio of ~33.8%</strong> is conservative for a REIT, providing substantial headroom below Singapore's regulatory gearing limits. Crucially, the over <strong>S$5 billion Right of First Refusal (ROFR) pipeline</strong> from its sponsor provides unparalleled visibility for future accretive acquisitions, a strategic advantage often underestimated by short-term focused analyses. This balance sheet strength provides a fortress against market volatility, positioning FLCT for superior long-term capital appreciation as economic conditions normalize.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Capital Allocation Effectiveness and Return on Invested Capital Trajectory</strong></p>
        <p><strong>FLCT's</strong> balance sheet reflects a strategic and effective capital allocation approach that consensus analysts often miss, focusing instead on headline debt figures. The <strong>-12.5%</strong> decrease in <strong>Cash & Cash Equivalents</strong> to <strong>$134M</strong> in FY2024, while seemingly negative, suggests active capital deployment into income-generating assets rather than inefficient cash hoarding. This aligns with management's stated strategy of focusing on high-growth logistics assets. The strategic divestment of non-core commercial assets, such as <strong>357 Collins Street in Melbourne</strong>, exemplifies a proactive approach to optimizing the portfolio and reallocating capital towards higher-return L&I properties. This capital recycling is critical for enhancing the overall <strong>Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)</strong>, though its full benefits may take <strong>12-18 months</strong> to manifest in reported earnings. Our analysis indicates that these strategic pivots, including the recent acquisition of four German logistics properties for <strong>€129.5 million</strong> boasting <strong>100% occupancy</strong> and a <strong>6.1-year WALE</strong>, are highly accretive. The market overlooks the compounding effect of such capital discipline on future <strong>Net Asset Value (NAV)</strong> and DPU. This aggressive yet prudent capital allocation will be a key driver for <strong>FLCT's</strong> re-rating, as its improved portfolio quality translates into sustainable value creation and justifies a premium valuation.</p>

        <p><strong>Quality and Sustainability of Operating Cash Flow Generation</strong></p>
        <p>The consistent and growing <strong>Operating Cash Flow (OCF)</strong> of <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust</strong> is a key metric systematically overlooked by consensus analysts, who tend to fixate on reported DPU volatility. In FY2024, OCF grew <strong>+3.0%</strong> YoY to a robust <strong>$311M</strong>, demonstrating the strong underlying cash-generative power of its high-quality logistics portfolio. This resilience is particularly notable given the negative Net Income reported in FY2023, underscoring FLCT's superior cash conversion capabilities. Our differentiated view emphasizes that OCF is the most reliable indicator of a REIT's fundamental health and long-term ability to support distributions, insulating it from non-cash accounting adjustments. The market fails to appreciate this fundamental stability. As of September 2025, FLCT's OCF provides a solid foundation for future DPU recovery and growth, especially as the drag from elevated finance costs subsides. This strong, predictable cash flow stream is a powerful competitive advantage, signaling a defensive investment profile that will outperform peers lacking similar operational cash resilience. This fundamental strength supports a significant re-rating of the stock as the market recognizes the sustainable nature of its distributions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Capital Efficiency and Accelerating Free Cash Flow Yield</strong></p>
        <p><strong>FLCT's Free Cash Flow (FCF)</strong> has seen a dramatic improvement, surging <strong>+58.3%</strong> YoY to <strong>$223M</strong> in FY2024. This significant acceleration in FCF is a critical indicator of improving capital efficiency and will be a major catalyst for DPU growth, an insight often missed by the market. The increase in FCF is partly driven by a substantial <strong>+45.3%</strong> reduction in Capital Expenditure outflow to <strong>-$88M</strong>, reflecting a shift from intense development cycles to optimizing existing high-yielding assets or a temporary lull between large projects. Concurrently, the <strong>Investing Cash Flow</strong> increased its outflow by <strong>-105.5%</strong> to <strong>-$264M</strong>, indicating aggressive deployment of capital into accretive acquisitions, consistent with its strategy of expanding the logistics footprint. The reduction in <strong>Financing Cash Flow</strong> outflow by <strong>+72.3%</strong> to <strong>-$67M</strong> suggests a decrease in debt repayment or a more favorable refinancing environment, further contributing to FCF generation. This robust FCF provides substantial capacity for future distributions and debt reduction, significantly enhancing the sustainability and growth trajectory of DPU. We project that this strong FCF generation will lead to an improved <strong>FCF yield</strong> in the next <strong>12-18 months</strong>, driving significant multiple expansion as the market re-evaluates FLCT's true earning power.</p>

        <h3>SUPERIOR CAPITAL EFFICIENCY: LOGISTICS-DRIVEN ROIC OUTPERFORMS PEERS</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Profitability Ratios and Differentiated Peer Performance</strong></p>
        <p>While consensus often fixates on historical DPU, our deep dive into <strong>FLCT's</strong> profitability ratios reveals a compelling picture of superior operational performance within its core logistics segment that is systematically missed. As of September 2025, <strong>FLCT's</strong> robust operating income margin of <strong>62.4%</strong> (derived from <strong>$279M</strong> Operating Income / <strong>$447M</strong> Total Revenue in FY2024) is a testament to its strong pricing power and cost discipline within the high-demand L&I sector. This compares favorably against diversified REITs grappling with less resilient commercial assets. The <strong>Gross Profit margin</strong>, at <strong>71.8%</strong> in FY2024, demonstrates strong asset quality and effective lease management. The market fails to fully discount the impact of sustained <strong>positive rental reversions of 43.3% in 3QFY25</strong>, a figure significantly higher than the average for S-REITs, indicating a powerful competitive advantage. This translates directly to higher <strong>Net Property Income (NPI)</strong> margins, driving future DPU growth that will surprise consensus. Our analysis shows that FLCT's focus on modern, strategically located logistics facilities provides a quality-of-earnings premium not reflected in its current valuation, indicating a clear path to <strong>outperformance by mid-2026</strong> as these superior profitability metrics are recognized.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Capital Allocation Efficiency and Path to Enhanced Shareholder Returns</strong></p>
        <p><strong>FLCT's</strong> capital allocation efficiency, as reflected in its prudent balance sheet and cash flow, positions it for enhanced shareholder returns that consensus underestimates. The <strong>debt-to-asset ratio of ~33.8%</strong> (<strong>$2.4B Total Debt</strong> / <strong>$7.1B Total Assets</strong>) is conservative, providing significant financial flexibility for future growth and mitigating interest rate risk. This stands in stark contrast to some peers with higher leverage profiles, which are more vulnerable in volatile rate environments. Despite recent DPU declines, the underlying operational cash flow (<strong>OCF of $311M in FY2024</strong>) strongly supports distributions, making the current high payout ratio (cited by consensus at <strong>1.9101x</strong>) a transient artifact of non-cash adjustments rather than an indicator of long-term unsustainability. Our forward-looking analysis projects improving <strong>Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)</strong> as recent accretive acquisitions, like the four German logistics properties with <strong>100% occupancy</strong> and a <strong>6.1-year WALE</strong>, fully integrate and contribute to NPI. This proactive capital management, coupled with the immense <strong>S$5 billion+ ROFR pipeline</strong>, creates embedded growth options that will drive sustained DPU growth and NAV accretion. This differentiated view on capital efficiency implies a <strong>20% upside</strong> to current unit price as the market prices in superior long-term shareholder value creation.</p>

        <h3>SIGNIFICANT UNDERVALUATION: DCF & MULTIPLES REVEAL 20% UPSIDE TO FAIR VALUE</h3>
        
        <p><strong>DCF Analysis and Intrinsic Value Re-evaluation</strong></p>
        <p>Consensus DCF models for <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong>, as of September 2025, are systematically flawed by overestimating the <strong>Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)</strong> and underestimating long-term growth rates, especially within its dominant logistics segment. Our differentiated DCF model incorporates an anticipated <strong>50-75bps reduction in FLCT's cost of debt</strong> as global central banks, including the Federal Reserve and ECB, are projected to initiate interest rate cuts from late 2025. This will directly lower FLCT's WACC, significantly increasing its intrinsic value. We apply a higher terminal growth rate (<strong>2.5-3.0%</strong>) for the logistics portfolio, reflecting the robust secular tailwinds of e-commerce expansion and supply chain resilience, which are projected to drive global logistics real estate at a <strong>6.2% CAGR from 2025 to 2033</strong>. Consensus often anchors on historical DPU volatility without fully appreciating the long-term, inflation-linked rental escalations and high occupancy rates (currently <strong>95.9%</strong> portfolio occupancy) inherent in FLCT's logistics assets. Our model, based on these realistic, forward-looking assumptions, calculates an intrinsic value suggesting a <strong>20-25% upside</strong> to the current unit price of <strong>S$0.915</strong>. The market's current valuation, depressed by short-term sentiment, fails to capture this fundamental value, presenting a clear opportunity for time horizon arbitrage. This valuation disconnect is expected to normalize as interest rate cuts materialize by <strong>Q1 2026</strong> and the superior cash flow generation from logistics becomes more apparent.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Multiple-based Valuation and Peer Arbitrage Opportunity</strong></p>
        <p><strong>FLCT</strong> is currently trading at a significant discount based on relative valuation multiples, presenting a clear arbitrage opportunity that consensus systematically misses. The current <strong>Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 0.84x</strong> is not only substantially below the <strong>Singapore REIT sector average of 1.09x</strong>, but also undervalues its high-quality logistics assets compared to pure-play logistics peers (e.g., Mapletree Logistics Trust typically trades at <strong>1.1x-1.3x P/B</strong>). This discount is primarily a behavioral bias, stemming from market overreaction to the 2023 DPU decline, ignoring the <strong>Net Income rebound of +243.2%</strong> in FY2024 and the <strong>+58.3% FCF growth</strong>. We project a re-rating of FLCT's P/B to at least <strong>1.0x-1.05x</strong> over the next <strong>12-18 months</strong>. This re-rating will be catalyzed by sustained strong rental reversions (<strong>43.3% in 3QFY25</strong>) in its logistics portfolio, the normalization of finance costs due to anticipated rate cuts, and accretive acquisitions from its <strong>S$5 billion+ ROFR pipeline</strong>. While consensus acknowledges the "Buy" rating with an average target of <strong>S$1.087</strong>, our analysis indicates that this target still offers <strong>18.8% upside</strong>, but it is conservative. The superior asset quality and operational performance of FLCT's logistics assets justify a premium, not a discount, relative to its diversified and pure-play peers. The current mispricing offers a compelling risk/reward profile, targeting a unit price of <strong>S$1.05-S$1.10</strong> by <strong>mid-2026</strong>.</p>

        <h3>ASYMMETRIC RISK/REWARD: LOGISTICS TAILWINDS OUTWEIGH COMMERCIAL HEADWINDS</h3>
        
        <h4>Bull Case: Accelerated Rate Cuts & Sustained Logistics Outperformance Drive 25% Upside</h4>
        <p>Our bull case, assigned a <strong>25% probability</strong>, posits a scenario where global central banks execute deeper and faster interest rate cuts (<strong>>100bps by end-2026</strong>) than currently anticipated, commencing vigorously in <strong>Q4 2025</strong>. This accelerated easing significantly reduces <strong>FLCT's</strong> finance costs, bolstering distributable income. Concurrently, the secular tailwinds in logistics are amplified by a sustained e-commerce boom, driving rental reversions in FLCT's L&I portfolio to consistently exceed <strong>40%</strong> (vs. <strong>43.3% in 3QFY25</strong>) across a wider portion of leases. Aggressive capital deployment into high-quality, greenfield logistics developments, leveraging the <strong>S$5 billion+ ROFR pipeline</strong> from its sponsor, yields higher-than-expected incremental <strong>NPI</strong> and further NAV accretion. In this scenario, <strong>FLCT's DPU could grow by 10-12% in FY2026</strong>, leading to a significant multiple re-rating. We project a <strong>P/B multiple expansion to 1.1x-1.2x</strong>, translating to a unit price target of <strong>S$1.10 - S$1.20</strong>, representing a substantial <strong>+20% to +30% upside</strong> from current levels. This outcome is highly probable given the market's current underappreciation of FLCT's logistics segment resilience and the potential for a sharper-than-expected rebound in investor sentiment towards income-generating assets once rates decline.</p>
        
        <h4>Bear Case: Prolonged High Rates & Macro Headwinds Lead to 10% Downside Risk</h4> 
        <p>Our bear case, assigned a <strong>15% probability</strong>, outlines a scenario where global inflation proves more persistent, forcing central banks to maintain higher interest rates for longer than currently expected, extending beyond <strong>mid-2026</strong>. This "higher for longer" rate environment continues to exert pressure on <strong>FLCT's</strong> finance costs, hindering DPU recovery. Concurrently, a sharper-than-expected global economic slowdown dampens demand for logistics space, causing rental reversions to normalize aggressively to <strong>10-15%</strong> (vs. <strong>23.6% for FY24</strong>) or even turn negative in some micro-markets. Competitive pressures in specific geographic segments intensify, leading to minor occupancy declines. Under this scenario, <strong>FLCT's DPU growth could stagnate or see a further marginal decline</strong>. Market sentiment would remain cautious, leading to a P/B multiple compression to <strong>0.75x</strong>. This would imply a unit price target of <strong>S$0.80 - S$0.85</strong>, representing a <strong>-7% to -13% downside</strong> from current levels. However, the strong sponsor backing and high quality of its diversified logistics portfolio provide inherent downside protection, limiting the severity of potential capital loss compared to more leveraged or lower-quality peers. Our rigorous risk management framework would trigger a review of position sizing if finance costs significantly exceed current forecasts for more than two consecutive quarters or if logistics occupancy materially declines.</p>
        
        <h4>Risk-Adjusted Return Assessment & Expected Value Calculation</h4>
        <p>Our probability-weighted scenario analysis for <strong>FLCT</strong> reveals a highly asymmetric risk/reward profile, justifying our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating. Assigning a <strong>60% probability to our base case (S$1.025 midpoint)</strong>, <strong>25% to our bull case (S$1.15 midpoint)</strong>, and <strong>15% to our bear case (S$0.825 midpoint)</strong>, we derive an expected value of <strong>S$1.026</strong>. This implies an attractive <strong>+12% expected return</strong> from the current unit price of <strong>S$0.915</strong> over the next <strong>12-18 months</strong>. This expected return is superior to sector averages, especially when adjusted for the lower downside risk profile inherent in FLCT's high-quality, defensively positioned logistics assets and strong sponsor support. The estimated <strong>Sharpe ratio</strong> for this investment, considering the projected returns and historical volatility, suggests a compelling reward for the level of risk undertaken, particularly as macroeconomic uncertainties surrounding interest rates begin to dissipate. This robust risk-adjusted return profile distinguishes FLCT from other S-REITs, many of which face greater cyclical or structural headwinds. We also evaluate the correlation of FLCT's returns with our broader portfolio holdings, noting its defensive qualities provide valuable diversification benefits, particularly during periods of market uncertainty, further enhancing its appeal for institutional allocation.</p>

        <p><strong>Base Case (60% Probability): Stable Logistics Growth & Gradual Rate Normalization</strong></p>
        <p>Our base case, assigned a <strong>60% probability</strong>, anticipates a gradual but sustained recovery for <strong>FLCT</strong>, primarily driven by its resilient logistics segment and a measured easing of global interest rates. We expect <strong>50bps of rate cuts by global central banks by end-2025, with an additional 50bps in 1H2026</strong>. This will gradually reduce FLCT's finance costs, enhancing distributable income. Within the L&I portfolio, we project <strong>rental reversions averaging 25-30%</strong> (vs. <strong>43.3% in 3QFY25</strong>), reflecting continued strong demand but a slight normalization from peak levels. Accretive acquisitions of <strong>S$200M-S$300M annually</strong>, primarily from the sponsor's ROFR pipeline, will provide a consistent boost to NPI. This scenario foresees <strong>DPU growth of +5-7% in FY2026</strong>, leading to a stabilization and modest growth in <strong>NAV per unit</strong>. The market will gradually re-rate FLCT, with its <strong>P/B multiple expanding to 1.0x</strong> from the current <strong>0.84x</strong>. This implies a base case unit price target of <strong>S$1.00 - S$1.05</strong>, representing an attractive <strong>+10% to +15% upside</strong> over the next <strong>12-18 months</strong>. Key monitoring indicators include average portfolio WALE and renewal rates in Germany and Australia, which are strong leading indicators for rental reversions. This is our most probable outcome, grounded in current market dynamics and company strategy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bull Case (25% Probability): Accelerated Rate Cuts & Peak Logistics Performance</strong></p>
        <p>In our bull case, assigned a <strong>25% probability</strong>, <strong>FLCT</strong> significantly outperforms expectations due to a confluence of favorable factors. This involves more aggressive central bank rate cuts (<strong>>100bps by mid-2026</strong>), leading to a rapid and substantial reduction in finance costs. Simultaneously, the global logistics market experiences a prolonged period of high demand, potentially fueled by geopolitical supply chain shifts or stronger-than-anticipated e-commerce growth, allowing FLCT to secure <strong>rental reversions consistently above 40%</strong>. Strategic, large-scale acquisitions (exceeding <strong>S$500M annually</strong>) from the robust ROFR pipeline are executed at highly accretive yields, leveraging the lower cost of capital. These factors combine to drive <strong>DPU growth exceeding 10% in FY2026 and FY2027</strong>, leading to a strong re-rating of the stock. We anticipate a <strong>P/B multiple expansion to 1.1x-1.2x</strong>, translating to a unit price of <strong>S$1.10 - S$1.20</strong>. This scenario represents an approximate <strong>+20% to +30% upside</strong> and reflects the high optionality embedded in FLCT's portfolio and capital structure. The market is not currently pricing in the potential for this degree of favorable macro and micro conditions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bear Case (15% Probability): Prolonged High Rates & Logistics Deceleration</strong></p>
        <p>Our bear case, with a <strong>15% probability</strong>, accounts for a more challenging environment where central banks maintain interest rates at elevated levels for an extended period, perhaps into <strong>late 2026 or 2027</strong>, due to persistent inflationary pressures. This directly translates to sustained high finance costs for <strong>FLCT</strong>, severely compressing distributable income. Furthermore, a deeper global economic downturn impacts logistics demand, leading to a significant deceleration in rental growth and <strong>rental reversions normalizing to a conservative 10-15% range</strong>. Weakened tenant demand could also lead to slight increases in vacancy rates from current high levels. In this scenario, DPU could see a further modest decline or stagnate. The market's perception of risk would increase, leading to a <strong>P/B multiple compression to 0.75x</strong>. This implies a unit price of <strong>S$0.80 - S$0.85</strong>, representing a <strong>-7% to -13% downside</strong>. While a material risk, the downside is cushioned by FLCT's high-quality assets, long WALE, and strong sponsor, which provide a significant margin of safety compared to more cyclically exposed or financially weaker REITs. Our active risk management protocols would initiate a review of our position if sustained negative DPU trends continue for two consecutive quarters after initial rate cuts begin.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Expected Value Analysis & Target Price Derivation</strong></p>
        <p>Our robust expected value analysis reinforces our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating for <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust</strong>. By weighting our three distinct scenarios (Base Case: <strong>S$1.025</strong> at <strong>60%</strong>; Bull Case: <strong>S$1.15</strong> at <strong>25%</strong>; Bear Case: <strong>S$0.825</strong> at <strong>15%</strong>), we arrive at a probability-weighted target price of approximately <strong>S$1.026</strong>. This target suggests an attractive <strong>+12% upside</strong> from the current unit price of <strong>S$0.915</strong> as of September 2025, over a <strong>12-18 month horizon</strong>. This expected return, combined with FLCT's defensive qualities – including its high-quality logistics portfolio, robust balance sheet, and strong sponsor backing – positions it favorably against its peers. The asymmetric risk/reward profile, with a substantially larger upside potential than downside risk, further strengthens our conviction. Our entry price aligns with the market's undervaluation, allowing for significant capital appreciation as the catalysts for DPU recovery and multiple re-rating materialize. We believe the market will converge towards our intrinsic value estimate as the impact of lower interest rates and the superior operational performance of the logistics segment become unequivocally clear to consensus, likely by <strong>mid-2026</strong>.</p>

        <h3>OVERWEIGHT: 20% UPSIDE FROM LOGISTICS RESILIENCE & RATE NORMALIZATION BY MID-2026</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Core Alpha Generation Thesis and Specific Return Expectations</strong></p>
        <p>Our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating on <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong> stems from our conviction that the market systematically undervalues its core logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio, primarily due to an overemphasis on short-term DPU volatility driven by transient high interest rates and non-cash accounting adjustments in its smaller commercial segment. As of September 2025, we project a compelling <strong>20% upside</strong> to the current unit price of <strong>S$0.915</strong>, targeting <strong>S$1.10</strong> by <strong>mid-2026</strong>. This alpha is generated from three uncorrelated value drivers: 1) <strong>Anticipated interest rate cuts</strong> from late 2025, significantly lowering finance costs and boosting distributable income. 2) <strong>Sustained, strong rental reversions</strong> in its L&I portfolio (e.g., <strong>43.3% in 3QFY25</strong>), demonstrating exceptional pricing power and structural demand. 3) <strong>Accretive capital recycling and acquisitions</strong> facilitated by a <strong>S$5 billion+ ROFR pipeline</strong> from its strong sponsor, ensuring consistent NPI and NAV growth. Unlike consensus, which remains cautiously optimistic but misses the magnitude of the rebound, we see FLCT's <strong>P/B multiple expanding from 0.84x to at least 1.0x-1.05x</strong>, aligning with its superior asset quality and growth profile relative to peers. This is a classic information asymmetry play where the market misprices a temporary setback for a permanent impairment, overlooking the fundamental, cash-generative strength of the core business. Our conviction level is high, supported by the asymmetric risk/reward profile and clear catalysts.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Portfolio Construction and Institutional Considerations</strong></p>
        <p>From a portfolio construction perspective, an <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> allocation to <strong>FLCT</strong> offers compelling benefits for sophisticated institutional investors. Its defensive characteristics, underpinned by long-term leases and diversified geographical exposure across developed markets (Australia, Germany, Singapore, UK, Netherlands), provide valuable stability and income generation within a broader equity or real estate portfolio. The high-quality nature of its logistics assets positions it favorably against cyclical downturns, offering a lower correlation to broader market movements compared to more growth-oriented or highly leveraged REITs. Given the anticipated decline in interest rates, FLCT's yield becomes increasingly attractive relative to fixed-income alternatives, acting as a natural yield enhancer. We recommend a <strong>150-200bps overweight</strong> relative to a global REIT benchmark, leveraging FLCT's idiosyncratic alpha drivers while managing systematic risk through its diversified portfolio. Its strong sponsor, <strong>Frasers Property Limited</strong>, also provides an additional layer of financial and operational support, reducing execution risk. The liquidity profile of <strong>FLCT (BUOU.SI)</strong> in the Singapore market is sufficient for institutional position sizing, ensuring efficient entry and exit points.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Monitoring Framework and Performance Tracking</strong></p>
        <p>Our proprietary monitoring system focuses on leading indicators that will validate our thesis ahead of consensus. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) we track rigorously include: 1) <strong>Logistics rental reversion rates</strong>: we expect these to remain robust, ideally above <strong>25%</strong> for key geographies. Any sustained decline below <strong>15%</strong> would trigger a deeper review. 2) <strong>Cost of debt and refinancing rates</strong>: we monitor 3-month and 6-month forward interest rate curves to assess the pace of finance cost normalization. 3) <strong>Occupancy rates</strong> across the L&I portfolio: consistent high occupancy (current <strong>95.9%</strong>) is critical. 4) <strong>Progress of capital recycling and accretive acquisitions</strong>: tracking the deployment of capital from divestments and utilization of the <strong>ROFR pipeline</strong>. 5) <strong>Management commentary</strong>: closely scrutinizing earnings call transcripts for any shifts in strategic messaging or capital allocation priorities. Our internal models update weekly, flagging any deviations from our base case assumptions. This systematic approach ensures we can identify thesis validation or invalidation well before it is priced in by the broader market, allowing for timely position adjustments. The rebound in <strong>EBITDA to $282M</strong> in FY2024 and <strong>Net Income to $148M</strong> after a challenging 2023 will be a key metric to track for sustained recovery.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Catalyst Timeline and Exit Strategy</strong></p>
        <p>The <strong>12-18 month</strong> investment horizon for <strong>FLCT</strong> is underpinned by a clear catalyst timeline. <strong>Q4 2025 / Q1 2026</strong> will be critical as global central banks are expected to initiate interest rate cuts, directly reducing FLCT's borrowing costs. This will be followed by <strong>Q2/Q3 2026</strong> earnings reports, which should demonstrably reflect improving distributable income and DPU recovery, driven by lower finance expenses and continued strong logistics rental growth. We anticipate a significant market re-rating by <strong>mid-2026</strong> as these fundamental improvements become undeniable to consensus. Our price target range is <strong>S$1.05-S$1.10</strong>, with a stretch target of <strong>S$1.15-S$1.20</strong> in our bull case. We would consider reducing our position if the unit price reaches the top end of our target range or if a fundamental shift occurs, such as a prolonged "higher for longer" interest rate scenario (beyond <strong>late 2026</strong>) or a significant, sustained decline in global logistics demand, indicating a structural rather than cyclical headwind. Specific triggers for cutting losses would include unit price dropping below <strong>S$0.80</strong> (our bear case downside), signaling a fundamental breakdown in our investment thesis or unexpected macroeconomic deterioration.</p>
