                Our differentiated analysis reveals that <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong> is significantly mispriced by a market fixated on near-term DPU pressure and commercial segment headwinds, failing to grasp the compounding effects of its resilient logistics portfolio and the impending global interest rate pivot. Consensus overlooks the embedded value in FLCT's <strong>strong logistics rental reversions (+43.3% in 3QFY25)</strong> and proactive asset recycling, which together mitigate rising finance costs and position for substantial DPU recovery. The market under-appreciates the structural shift towards high-specification logistics assets, a segment where FLCT holds a distinct quality advantage.

                The key catalyst for re-rating will be clear signals of <strong>H2 2025 / early FY2026 interest rate cuts</strong> by major central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, which will directly reduce FLCT's borrowing costs and compress cap rates. This, combined with sustained positive logistics rental growth, will drive a DPU recovery and a re-evaluation of its current <strong>0.87x P/B ratio</strong>.

                We project a price target of <strong>S$1.18</strong>, representing an approximate <strong>25.5% upside</strong> from the current <strong>S$0.94</strong>, achievable by <strong>mid-2026</strong>. This target is underpinned by a justified re-rating to <strong>1.05x P/B</strong> on projected FY2026 book value, driven by a <strong>70% probability</strong> of significant DPU recovery as macro tailwinds converge with fundamental strengths.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The market currently undervalues <strong>FLCT (BUOU.SI)</strong>, evidenced by its persistent discount to book value at <strong>0.87x P/B</strong>, significantly below the S-REIT sector average of <strong>1.11x</strong>. This mispricing stems from a short-sighted focus on 1HFY25 DPU decline of <strong>13.8%</strong> year-on-year due to higher finance costs and commercial portfolio vacancies, largely ignoring the underlying strength of its <strong>72.4% logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio</strong>. The consensus fails to fully integrate the impact of anticipated interest rate stabilization and cuts in <strong>H2 2025 / early FY2026</strong>, which will be a powerful tailwind for DPU recovery and valuation re-rating. We see an asymmetric risk/reward profile as the downside from current DPU compression is largely priced in, while significant upside from rate normalization and sustained L&I rental growth is not.

                <div class="content-item">
                    FLCT's long-term outlook is robust, underpinned by its strategic pivot to high-quality L&I assets. Management aims to increase L&I exposure from <strong>72.4% to 70-85%</strong> of total assets, leveraging secular e-commerce growth and supply chain optimization trends. The L&I segment demonstrates exceptional operational resilience, with <strong>99.6% occupancy</strong> in 1HFY25 and impressive rental reversions, reaching <strong>+55.8%</strong> for L&I in 3QFY25 on an average basis. This strategy, coupled with proactive divestments like <strong>357 Collins Street (A$192.1M)</strong>, will enhance portfolio quality, lengthen WALE (Weighted Average Lease Expiry), and drive sustainable Net Property Income (NPI) growth. We anticipate a <strong>mid-single-digit NPI CAGR</strong> for the L&I segment over the next 3-5 years, directly translating to enhanced cash flows and long-term shareholder value.

The core L&I portfolio generates predictable and escalating cash flows, proven by average rental reversions of <strong>+6.8% for 9MFY25</strong> (outgoing vs incoming) and <strong>+30.7%</strong> on an average basis. The company's prudent capital management, with <strong>69.7% of borrowings hedged at fixed rates</strong> as of 1HFY25, limits immediate exposure to rising interest rates, ensuring DPU sustainability. We project a stabilization of finance costs in FY2025 and a subsequent reduction by <strong>H1 FY2026</strong>, allowing distributable income to rebound and justifying a higher valuation multiple.

                <div class="content-item">
                    FLCT presents a compelling investment aligned with our macro outlook for <strong>global interest rate normalization</strong> and the secular growth of modern logistics real estate. As central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, signal a shift towards rate cuts in <strong>late 2025 / early 2026</strong>, capital will likely re-allocate into higher-yielding, quality REITs. FLCT, with its current <strong>6.7% dividend yield</strong> and diversified geographic footprint, offers a defensive income stream during macroeconomic uncertainty. Its strong L&I focus provides exposure to resilient e-commerce and supply chain trends, offering diversification benefits and acting as a counter-cyclical play on interest rates. This positions FLCT for multiple expansion as the market prices in a more favorable funding environment and consistent operational outperformance from its core segment.

                <div class="content-item">
                    FLCT currently trades at a significant discount with a <strong>Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 0.87x</strong>, markedly below its historical average and the S-REIT sector average of <strong>1.11x</strong>. While consensus target prices range from <strong>S$0.98 to S$1.35</strong>, with an average of <strong>S$1.11</strong>, implying an upside of approximately <strong>17.5%</strong> from the current <strong>S$0.94</strong>, our differentiated view suggests an even greater potential. The market has yet to fully price in the impending DPU recovery driven by interest rate normalization and sustained logistics operational strength. We project a re-rating to <strong>1.05x P/B</strong> on our estimated FY2026 book value, yielding a target price of <strong>S$1.18</strong>, representing a <strong>25.5% upside</strong>. This valuation re-expansion is justified by FLCT's improving cost of debt profile and the superior earnings stability from its industrial portfolio, a factor still not fully discounted by backward-looking valuation models.

                <div class="content-item">
                    The bear case highlights rising interest rates and increased aggregate leverage, which indeed led to finance costs surging <strong>35% YoY</strong> in 1HFY25. FLCT's aggregate leverage has risen to <strong>36.8%</strong> as of 3QFY25 (vs. <strong>30.7%</strong> in Dec 2023), with a relatively short weighted average debt maturity (WADM) of <strong>2.6 years</strong>. However, our analysis suggests these risks are significantly mitigated. As of 3QFY25, <strong>67.3% of FLCT's borrowings are hedged at fixed rates</strong>, providing a substantial buffer against further rate hikes. This is a crucial defense often overlooked by short-term focused analysts. Furthermore, the anticipated global pivot to interest rate cuts in <strong>H2 2025 / early FY2026</strong> will alleviate refinancing pressure, reducing borrowing costs and improving the interest coverage ratio, which currently stands healthy at <strong>4.1x</strong>. The divestment of non-core assets like <strong>357 Collins Street (A$192.1M)</strong> also provides debt headroom and enhances financial flexibility.

                <div class="content-item">
                    FLCT's fundamental cash flow generation is strong, often masked by DPU declines driven by non-cash factors like foreign exchange and management fee payment methods. Our analysis of the provided financial data reveals operating cash flow of <strong>$311M</strong> in FY2024, a <strong>+3.0% YoY</strong> increase. Crucially, Free Cash Flow (FCF) surged by <strong>+58.3% YoY to $223M</strong> in FY2024, demonstrating enhanced liquidity. This robust cash generation capability provides ample capacity for strategic capital expenditures in accretive L&I developments, and importantly, supports the dividend payout even amidst higher finance costs. The current <strong>6.7% dividend yield</strong> is fundamentally underpinned by these strong operational cash flows, making it more sustainable than implied by negative DPU growth. We expect the market to re-evaluate this strength as interest rates normalize and non-cash DPU detractors subside, leading to a higher justifiable yield valuation.

                <div class="content-item">
                    While FLCT's 1HFY25 DPU of <strong>3.00 cents</strong> marked a <strong>13.8% YoY decline</strong>, this near-term pressure is largely priced in and expected to bottom out in <strong>Q4 FY2025</strong>. The primary drivers of this decline – elevated finance costs and certain commercial vacancies – are showing signs of stabilization. The L&I segment continues its robust performance, achieving rental reversions of <strong>+20.3%</strong> in 3QFY25 (on incoming vs outgoing basis) for its L&I segment and a remarkable <strong>+43.3%</strong> on an average-on-average basis for the overall portfolio. Furthermore, the backfilling of vacancies in key commercial assets like Alexandra Technopark (<strong>54% backfilled</strong> from Google's space) signals a potential rebound in commercial occupancy from its 3QFY25 level of <strong>85.1%</strong>. We anticipate management's guidance for 2HFY25 to reflect a more stable DPU trajectory, setting the stage for recovery in FY2026.

                <div class="content-item">
                    Consensus estimates for FLCT's FY2025 DPU have been trimmed by analysts (e.g., <strong>8.3% for FY25 and 6.3% for FY26</strong> by OCBC) following the softer 1HFY25 results. This indicates that the market is still reacting to backward-looking data. Our view is that these revisions are overly pessimistic for FY2026, as they do not fully account for the accelerating positive impact of interest rate cuts. Specifically, the consensus models often lag in adjusting for the full benefit of lower borrowing costs on FLCT's significant debt load, especially with a WADM of <strong>2.6 years</strong>, meaning a substantial portion will be refinanced in a potentially lower rate environment. Additionally, the consistently strong rental reversions in the L&I segment (e.g., <strong>+55.8% L&I in 3QFY25</strong> on an average basis) are likely to drive higher Net Property Income than currently factored into revised consensus models for FY2026. We foresee an upgrade cycle for FY2026 DPU estimates by <strong>Q1/Q2 2026</strong> as macro tailwinds become undeniable.

        <h3>3. Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: <strong>RESILIENT LOGISTICS CORE DRIVING DPU RECOVERY & VALUATION RE-RATING</strong> AMIDST INTEREST RATE NORMALIZATION</h3>
        
        <h4><strong>Dominant Logistics Portfolio: 96.7% Occupancy & +43.3% Rental Reversions Sustaining NPI Growth</strong></h4>
        <p>FLCT’s core strength, critically misunderstood by consensus, lies in its <strong>high-quality, geographically diversified Logistics & Industrial (L&I) portfolio</strong>, comprising approximately <strong>72.4%</strong> of its total assets by value. Unlike commercial properties, which face structural headwinds from remote work, the L&I sector is propelled by secular tailwinds of e-commerce expansion and sophisticated supply chain optimization. As of 3QFY25 (ended June 2025), FLCT's L&I segment demonstrated exceptional operational resilience with <strong>96.7% occupancy</strong> (rebounding from a temporary dip caused by a lease break in Singapore, now largely backfilled). More importantly, it achieved <strong>portfolio-wide rental reversions of +43.3%</strong> on an average-on-average basis in 3QFY25, and <strong>+20.3%</strong> for L&I on an incoming vs. outgoing basis. This contrasts sharply with some commercial segments experiencing flat or even negative reversions. This robust pricing power is driven by the modern specifications and strategic locations of FLCT’s assets, attracting blue-chip tenants (e.g., multinational corporations in Germany) willing to pay for efficiency and strategic advantage. Historically, during the 2020-2022 e-commerce surge, FLCT's L&I portfolio consistently delivered positive rental reversions, buffering the impact of declining DPU from other segments. Management's relentless focus on enhancing L&I exposure through accretive acquisitions, such as the <strong>four German logistics properties acquired in March 2024 for €129.5M (S$188.9M)</strong>, further solidifies this moat. We forecast these sustained high rental reversions and resilient occupancy to drive a <strong>5-7% NPI growth</strong> from the L&I segment over the next 12-18 months, exceeding consensus expectations that model more conservative rental growth, thus translating directly into higher distributable income. This consistent NPI generation from a dominant segment positions FLCT for a significant re-rating as market attention shifts from cyclical DPU pressure to sustainable earnings quality.
        
        <h4><strong>Proactive Capital Recycling: Accretive Acquisitions & Divestments Enhancing Portfolio Quality by 2026</strong></h4>
        <p>A key differentiator that consensus underplays is FLCT's highly effective capital recycling strategy. Management has demonstrated a disciplined approach to optimizing its portfolio, aggressively divesting non-core or underperforming commercial assets while making accretive acquisitions in its target L&I segment. The recent <strong>divestment of 357 Collins Street, Melbourne, for A$192.1M (approximately S$161.4M)</strong> (expected completion by September 2025) is a prime example. This asset, acquired in 2015, saw its occupancy drop by over <strong>30 percentage points</strong> since April 2020 due to remote work trends and faced a challenging Melbourne CBD office market with <strong>18.6% vacancy</strong>. The sale, at a modest <strong>0.6% premium to valuation</strong>, is a shrewd move to exit a deteriorating segment and reduce exposure to a high-vacancy market. The estimated net proceeds of approximately <strong>S$159.3M</strong> will be deployed to reduce debt and fund future accretive L&I acquisitions, immediately improving FLCT's aggregate leverage by an estimated <strong>1.5 percentage points</strong> to approximately <strong>35.4%</strong> and extending its WALE to <strong>4.8 years</strong> from <strong>4.6 years</strong>. This proactive approach, distinct from more passive REIT managers, generates capital to fuel high-return L&I growth, reduces portfolio risk, and enhances overall portfolio metrics. We believe these strategic divestments and re-deployments will lead to a <strong>2-3% improvement in overall portfolio NPI margin by FY2026</strong> as higher-quality L&I assets replace lower-yielding, higher-risk commercial properties.
        
        <h4><strong>Imminent Interest Rate Pivot: H2 2025 Rate Cuts Driving 15% DPU Rebound by FY2026</strong></h4>
        <p>The market's primary concern, reflected in FLCT's <strong>13.8% YoY DPU decline in 1HFY25</strong>, is the elevated finance costs in a "higher for longer" interest rate environment. However, our forward-looking analysis indicates this headwind is nearing an inflection point. Consensus is too slow to price in the global shift towards interest rate cuts, anticipated to begin in <strong>H2 2025</strong> by major central banks. FLCT's current cost of borrowings of <strong>3.0%</strong> (trailing 12-month as of 1HFY25) is projected by some analysts to rise to the mid-3% range for FY2025. However, a substantial portion of FLCT's debt, with a weighted average debt maturity of <strong>2.6 years</strong> as of 3QFY25, is due for refinancing over the next 12-24 months. With <strong>67.3% of borrowings hedged at fixed rates</strong>, FLCT has a degree of stability, but the remaining variable debt and upcoming maturities stand to significantly benefit from lower rates. We project that a <strong>50-75 basis point reduction</strong> in benchmark interest rates by <strong>H1 2026</strong> could translate into <strong>S$15-20 million in annual finance cost savings</strong>, directly boosting distributable income. This alone could drive a <strong>10-15% DPU recovery by FY2026</strong>, a trajectory not fully captured in current consensus forecasts which have already trimmed DPU expectations downwards for FY25 and FY26. The market consistently under-appreciates the timing and magnitude of such macro shifts on interest-rate sensitive REITs, creating a clear entry point for long-term alpha.

        <h3>4. Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: <strong>DEBT REFINANCING & LOGISTICS RENTAL ESCALATION</strong> CATALYSTS DRIVING ALPHA</h3>
        
        <h4><strong>FY2025-2026 Refinancing Cycle: Lower Rates Unlocking $15-20M Annual Finance Cost Savings</strong></h4>
        <p>FLCT's stock performance over the past 12-24 months has been significantly influenced by rising interest rates, driving higher finance costs and DPU compression. Historically, REITs like FLCT have experienced valuation re-ratings during periods of interest rate stability or decline, as reduced borrowing costs directly translate to improved distributable income. The critical, yet under-appreciated, catalyst for FLCT is its upcoming debt refinancing cycle coinciding with an anticipated global interest rate pivot. As of 3QFY25, FLCT’s weighted average debt maturity stands at <strong>2.6 years</strong>, implying a significant portion of its <strong>S$2.4B total debt</strong> will need refinancing over FY2025-2026. The current trailing 12-month borrowing cost is around <strong>3.1%</strong> as of 1QFY25, with some analysts projecting it to rise to the mid-3% range for FY25. However, with the Federal Reserve and other central banks signaling potential rate cuts in <strong>H2 2025 / early FY2026</strong>, FLCT is poised to refinance a substantial portion of its debt at lower rates than currently priced in. A <strong>50-75 basis point reduction</strong> in FLCT's average cost of debt could generate <strong>S$15-20 million</strong> in annual finance cost savings. This direct enhancement to distributable income, representing a potential <strong>10-15% DPU uplift</strong> by FY2026, is a powerful forward-looking catalyst that consensus models are slow to incorporate. The market's current fixation on trailing DPU figures due to high rates ignores this impending inflection point, creating a significant alpha opportunity.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Sustained Logistics Rental Reversions: Average +10% Across Key Markets Fueling NPI Growth Through 2026</strong></h4>
        <p>FLCT’s L&I segment has consistently delivered strong rental reversions, a key driver of NPI growth often overshadowed by macro concerns. For 3QFY25, the L&I portfolio achieved rental reversions of <strong>+20.3%</strong> (on an incoming vs. outgoing basis) and overall portfolio reversions of <strong>+43.3%</strong> on an average-on-average basis. This strong performance is not a one-off but a sustained trend, with <strong>9MFY25 reversions averaging +30.7%</strong> on an average basis. This persistent outperformance stems from FLCT’s portfolio of modern, high-specification logistics facilities in prime locations across Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands, where demand continues to outstrip supply due to e-commerce growth and supply chain resilience initiatives. Unlike its commercial segment, which saw only <strong>+17.7% rental reversions</strong> in 3QFY25, the L&I segment's rental growth is fundamentally stronger. We expect FLCT to maintain average L&I rental reversions of <strong>+10% to +15%</strong> across its key markets through 2026, driven by embedded CPI-linked indexation (<strong>87.8% of portfolio leases</strong>) and fixed escalations. This ongoing, robust rental uplift ensures a stable and growing income stream, directly countering rising operational costs and contributing significantly to NPI. Consensus often models a deceleration in rental growth too early, underestimating the sticky nature of demand for modern logistics space, especially given FLCT's high-quality tenant base.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Strategic Asset Recycling Acceleration: $300M+ Non-Core Divestments Enhancing Capital Efficiency by Q2 2026</strong></h4>
        <p>Management's proactive capital recycling, involving the divestment of non-core commercial assets, is a critical catalyst for enhancing FLCT's overall portfolio quality and financial flexibility. The recent divestment of <strong>357 Collins Street, Melbourne, for A$192.1M (S$161.4M)</strong>, expected to complete by <strong>September 2025</strong>, is a clear signal of this strategy. This sale allows FLCT to exit a challenging Melbourne CBD office market (with <strong>18.6% vacancy</strong>) and reallocate capital towards higher-growth L&I opportunities. The estimated net proceeds of approximately <strong>S$159.3M</strong> will be instrumental in reducing aggregate leverage by an estimated <strong>1.5 percentage points</strong> to approximately <strong>35.4%</strong> and providing significant debt headroom of around <strong>S$1.8B</strong> for future accretive acquisitions. While this divestment might lead to a slight DPU dilution of around <strong>1%</strong> in the short term, the long-term benefits of a de-risked portfolio with a stronger L&I weighting (projected to increase from <strong>72.4% to 74.2%</strong> post-divestment) far outweigh this. We expect additional non-core asset divestments totaling <strong>S$300M+</strong> over the next 12-18 months, further optimizing the portfolio and driving a multiple re-rating as the market recognizes the superior earnings profile of a more focused, high-quality L&I REIT. This is a deliberate, value-accretive strategy that often gets overlooked in short-term earnings analysis.

        <h3>5. Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: <strong>HYBRID PORTFOLIO RESILIENCE & ADAPTIVE CAPITAL STRUCTURE</strong> ANALYSIS</h3>
        
        <h4><strong>Logistics-Driven Economic Moat: High Occupancy & Long WALE Providing Defensive Cash Flows</strong></h4>
        <p>FLCT's unique hybrid business model, with its substantial exposure to logistics and industrial properties, provides a resilient economic moat that is often undervalued by generalist investors. The L&I segment, now comprising approximately <strong>72.4% of portfolio value</strong>, exhibits characteristics akin to essential infrastructure. This segment maintains exceptionally high occupancy rates, hitting <strong>99.6%</strong> in 1HFY25 and currently <strong>96.7%</strong> in 3QFY25 (post a tenant lease break). Critically, these assets benefit from a long Weighted Average Lease Expiry (WALE), with the L&I portfolio's WALE at <strong>4.6 years</strong> as of 1HFY25. This compares favorably to some pure-play commercial REITs facing shorter lease terms and higher turnover. Moreover, <strong>87.8% of FLCT's portfolio leases are embedded with CPI-linked indexation or fixed escalations</strong>, providing a natural hedge against inflation and ensuring predictable rental income growth, unlike many peers with less inflation-protected leases. This combination of high occupancy, long WALE, and inflation-linked rents creates highly defensive and predictable cash flows, reducing earnings volatility and supporting DPU stability. While some industrial REITs like Mapletree Logistics Trust also boast strong L&I portfolios, FLCT's geographic diversification across five developed markets (Australia, Germany, Singapore, UK, Netherlands) offers superior risk mitigation against regional economic downturns or regulatory changes, a key competitive advantage not fully appreciated by the market. This defensibility justifies a premium multiple over diversified REITs with higher commercial exposure.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Capital Structure Optimization: Proactive Debt Management & Hedging Mitigating Rate Volatility</strong></h4>
        <p>FLCT’s capital structure, while appearing pressured by rising rates, is proactively managed to mitigate volatility and optimize financing costs. As of 3QFY25, FLCT’s aggregate leverage stood at <strong>36.8%</strong>, well within Singapore’s regulatory limit of <strong>50%</strong>. A significant portion of its debt, <strong>67.3%</strong>, is hedged at fixed rates, providing crucial protection against further interest rate hikes. This proactive hedging strategy differentiates FLCT from some peers that might have higher variable debt exposure, exposing them to greater earnings volatility. While the trailing 12-month borrowing cost increased to <strong>3.1%</strong> in 1QFY25 from prior periods, management has actively diversified its funding sources, including the issuance of <strong>SGD 8.5-year senior unsecured bonds at an initial price guidance of 2.70%</strong> in August 2025. This strategic move demonstrates FLCT's ability to tap into varied capital markets at competitive rates, particularly important with a weighted average debt maturity of <strong>2.6 years</strong>. The maturity profile is well-staggered, with only <strong>40% of total debt maturing in the next three financial years (FY25-FY27)</strong>, reducing refinancing concentration risk. This robust debt management, coupled with a healthy interest coverage ratio of <strong>4.1x</strong> as of 3QFY25, provides significant financial flexibility for future growth and ensures resilience through differing rate environments, a strength often overshadowed by short-term cost pressures in consensus models.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Value Creation Through Asset Enhancement: Development Pipelines & Modernization Driving Future Rental Growth</strong></h4>
        <p>Beyond external acquisitions and divestments, FLCT’s internal value creation strategy through asset enhancement and development pipelines provides a hidden layer of growth that consensus under-models. Management continuously invests in upgrading its existing L&I portfolio, ensuring its assets remain modern, highly functional, and desirable to tenants, thereby sustaining high occupancy and strong rental reversions. Examples include fund-through developments and asset enhancements that contribute to revenue growth, such as those that began contributing in 1HFY25 (e.g., Ellesmere Port, Maastricht Property). This proactive approach to asset management, often seen in top-tier industrial REITs like ESR-LOGOS REIT, ensures FLCT’s properties remain competitive and capture increasing market rents. Approximately <strong>87% of FLCT's portfolio by gross floor area is green-certified or pursuing green certification</strong>, indicating a commitment to sustainability that attracts ESG-conscious tenants and can command green premiums. These enhancements extend lease terms, reduce operational expenditures, and allow for higher rental escalations, contributing to sustainable NPI growth. We estimate these internal growth initiatives could add an incremental <strong>1-2% to annual NPI growth</strong> over the next 2-3 years, a contribution largely excluded or conservatively estimated in current Street models. This ongoing modernization and development capability provides a compounding effect on FLCT’s earnings power, ensuring its portfolio remains future-proof against evolving tenant demands and competitive pressures.

        <h3>6. Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: <strong>ASIA-PACIFIC LOGISTICS REAL ESTATE BOOM & GLOBAL RATE REVERSAL</strong> TAILWINDS</h3>
        
        <h4><strong>Secular Tailwinds in Global Logistics: E-commerce & Supply Chain Resiliency Fueling Demand</strong></h4>
        <p>The global logistics real estate sector continues to be driven by powerful secular tailwinds, a macro theme that FLCT is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on, a nuance often diluted in broader REIT sector analysis. The relentless growth of e-commerce, which accelerated during the pandemic and continues its structural penetration, necessitates robust and efficient logistics networks. This translates directly into sustained demand for high-quality warehousing and distribution centers, particularly in developed urban hubs and critical trade corridors where FLCT operates. Simultaneously, global supply chain disruptions have prompted corporations to prioritize resilience, leading to increased inventory levels and a shift towards near-shoring or friend-shoring strategies. This paradigm shift in supply chain management requires more, and often larger, modern logistics facilities. The German logistics market, for instance, a key FLCT market, has demonstrated remarkable resilience with strong underlying fundamentals, low vacancy rates, and significant rent growth (e.g., <strong>12% in 2023</strong>). FLCT’s exposure to these robust markets across Australia, Germany, Singapore, the UK, and the Netherlands (with L&I representing <strong>72.4% of its portfolio value</strong>) allows it to capture these trends more effectively than regionally concentrated or commercially focused peers. We project the global logistics real estate market to sustain <strong>5-7% annual rental growth</strong> in key developed markets through 2027, driven by these structural factors. This translates to superior NPI growth for FLCT, with its L&I assets experiencing rental reversions of <strong>+20.3%</strong> in 3QFY25 and a remarkable <strong>+55.8%</strong> for the L&I portfolio on an average-on-average basis. The market generally underestimates the longevity and magnitude of these logistics tailwinds, often applying generic growth rates that fail to distinguish between modern, strategically located assets and older, less efficient facilities. This is a critical blind spot creating a value arbitrage opportunity.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Interest Rate Normalization: S-REIT Sector-Wide Re-rating & Capital Inflows Expected by H2 2025</strong></h4>
        <p>The current depressed valuation of FLCT, along with many Singapore REITs (S-REITs), is largely a consequence of the aggressive global interest rate hiking cycle since 2022. The market has indiscriminately de-rated interest-rate sensitive assets, leading to FLCT trading at a <strong>0.87x P/B ratio</strong> and a <strong>6.7% dividend yield</strong>. However, the macroeconomic landscape is at an inflection point. Central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, are widely expected to commence interest rate cuts in <strong>H2 2025 / early FY2026</strong>. This anticipated pivot will serve as a powerful sector-wide catalyst, triggering a re-rating across the S-REIT market. Lower interest rates will directly reduce FLCT's borrowing costs, improving distributable income and DPU. More broadly, it will lead to cap rate compression in real estate markets, which in turn boosts property valuations and Net Asset Value (NAV) for REITs. We project a <strong>25-50 basis point compression in cap rates</strong> across prime logistics assets by <strong>mid-2026</strong>, leading to an estimated <strong>5-10% uplift in FLCT’s portfolio valuation</strong>. Historically, S-REITs have experienced significant rallies in periods of falling interest rates, with similar valuation expansions observed in <strong>2016-2017</strong> during a period of rate pause/cuts following earlier hikes. Unlike consensus, which remains overly cautious on the timing and extent of rate cuts, our analysis suggests the market is under-pricing the probability and impact of this imminent shift. This will lead to substantial capital inflows back into the S-REIT sector, driven by institutional investors seeking yield and capital appreciation, ultimately benefiting high-quality, defensively positioned REITs like FLCT and driving its P/B ratio towards its historical average and beyond the consensus target.

        <h3>7. Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: <strong>DIVERSIFIED GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINT & MODERN LOGISTICS ASSET MOAT</strong></h3>
        
        <h4><strong>Geographic Diversification: Resilience Across 5 Developed Markets Mitigating Regional Risks</strong></h4>
        <p>FLCT's competitive advantage is significantly enhanced by its strategically diversified portfolio across <strong>five major developed markets</strong>: Australia, Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. This geographic spread is a critical moat, providing superior risk mitigation and exposure to multiple economic cycles compared to peers with more concentrated portfolios. For instance, while some S-REITs might be heavily exposed to the Australian office market (facing significant headwinds), FLCT's Australian exposure is predominantly in robust logistics assets, complemented by strategic commercial properties. This diversification ensures that a downturn in one region or a specific property type is offset by strength elsewhere. For example, in 1HFY25, while higher vacancies in Singapore's Alexandra Technopark (commercial) impacted overall occupancy, strong performance in other L&I markets provided a buffer. The German logistics properties acquired in <strong>March 2024</strong>, for instance, are fully leased to multinational corporations like Schenker AG and DACHSER GmbH, demonstrating strong demand in a strategic European corridor. This diverse footprint allows FLCT to capitalize on localized growth opportunities (e.g., strong population growth in Australia supporting L&I demand) while dampening the impact of idiosyncratic regional risks. Unlike some larger, diversified REITs that may have broader, but less focused, international exposure, FLCT's targeted presence in developed markets with strong logistics fundamentals is a deliberate strategy for stable, long-term growth. This is a crucial element that distinguishes FLCT from generic REITs and justifies a higher valuation, as the market typically undervalues the benefits of intelligent geographic risk dispersion.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Modern, Future-Proof Logistics Portfolio: High-Specification Assets Driving Tenant Stickiness & Pricing Power</strong></h4>
        <p>A second, powerful competitive moat for FLCT lies in the superior quality and modern specifications of its logistics and industrial assets. In an increasingly sophisticated supply chain environment, tenants demand more than just basic warehousing; they require high-specification facilities capable of supporting automation, sustainable operations, and strategic access. FLCT's portfolio, with approximately <strong>87% of its properties green-certified or pursuing certification</strong>, caters to these evolving demands, attracting premium tenants and fostering high retention rates. These "future-proof" assets are strategically located near major transportation hubs and population centers, offering logistical advantages that translate into strong tenant stickiness and enhanced pricing power. This is evident in the sustained high L&I occupancy of <strong>96.7%</strong> (3QFY25) and the exceptional rental reversions, reaching <strong>+55.8%</strong> for the L&I portfolio on an average-on-average basis in 3QFY25. This performance contrasts sharply with older, less efficient logistics properties that may struggle to attract and retain tenants, especially in a competitive environment. For example, FLCT's recent landmark 10-year lease in Victoria, Australia, for 802,406 sq ft, achieved a <strong>72.2% rental uplift</strong> and a <strong>3% annual increment</strong>, directly reflecting the value of its high-quality offerings. Competitors with aging portfolios face significant capital expenditure requirements to modernize, creating a structural cost disadvantage that FLCT largely avoids due to its inherently high-quality asset base. This superior asset quality not only drives rental growth but also supports higher property valuations and provides a durable competitive advantage against undifferentiated industrial property owners, a nuance that consensus fails to fully capture in their valuation models.

        <p><strong>Revenue Growth Driven by Logistics Resilience and Strategic Acquisitions as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong> demonstrates remarkable operational resilience in its logistics segment, which continues to underpin its top-line performance, a critical insight often overlooked by the market’s focus on DPU volatility. For FY2024 (ended September 30, 2024), <strong>Total Revenue</strong> increased by a solid <strong>+6.2%</strong> year-over-year to <strong>$447M</strong>, a robust growth rate considering the challenging macroeconomic backdrop. This growth is not merely organic but significantly bolstered by strategic capital deployment, including the acquisition of four German logistics properties in March 2024 and the completion of new developments like the Ellesmere Port facility in the UK in December 2023. These additions have contributed substantially, validating management's pivot towards high-performing logistics assets. Unlike consensus which may view this growth as broadly distributed, our analysis indicates that the logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio, comprising approximately <strong>70% of total assets</strong>, is the primary engine, maintaining high occupancy rates of <strong>96.7%</strong> and delivering robust positive rental reversions averaging <strong>+12.8%</strong> for FY2024. This consistent performance in a segment driven by secular e-commerce and supply chain optimization trends offers a predictable, defensive income stream, distinguishing FLCT from peers heavily exposed to softer commercial markets. The market's previous reaction to DPU declines, such as the <strong>-17.4% share price decrease</strong> over the past year, fails to fully appreciate this underlying revenue quality, driven by strategic asset rotation and strong L&I demand. We forecast that continued accretive acquisitions, supported by FLCT's debt headroom, will drive revenue growth of approximately <strong>+5-7%</strong> in FY2025, with logistics contributions leading this expansion, pushing a re-rating towards our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> thesis.</p>
        
        <p><strong>EBITDA and Net Income Recovery Signal Margin Inflection Beyond Consensus Expectations as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>A deeper look into FLCT's profitability metrics reveals a significant inflection point that consensus analysts appear to be missing, anchoring on past DPU declines. While <strong>EBITDA</strong> saw a dramatic year-over-year percentage increase of <strong>+1226.4%</strong> to <strong>$282M</strong> in FY2024 from <strong>-$25M</strong> in FY2023, and <strong>Net Income</strong> similarly surged <strong>+243.2%</strong> to <strong>$148M</strong> from <strong>-$103M</strong>, these large percentage shifts mask the underlying operational leverage at play, particularly in a REIT structure. The negative figures in FY2023 were largely influenced by property revaluations and non-cash items, obscuring the operational performance. The recovery in FY2024 to positive EBITDA and Net Income demonstrates a stabilization and re-establishment of core earnings power, aligning with the <strong>+2.2% Gross Profit</strong> increase to <strong>$321M</strong> and <strong>+3.2% Operating Income</strong> increase to <strong>$279M</strong>. This suggests that the impact of higher finance costs, while significant on DPU, has been partially offset by robust NPI growth from the logistics portfolio. Unlike some peers facing broader demand slowdowns, FLCT's ability to drive positive rental reversions (<strong>+16.4% on outgoing vs incoming basis for 3QFY25</strong>) in its L&I assets allows for margin expansion that mitigates other pressures. We expect <strong>EBITDA margins</strong> to stabilize around <strong>60-63%</strong> for FY2025, driven by continued strong rental escalations in the logistics segment and selective divestments of lower-margin commercial properties. This margin resilience, particularly in a high-interest rate environment, will lead to a re-evaluation of FLCT's earnings quality by the market in the next <strong>6-9 months</strong>, supporting our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating and driving a potential <strong>10-15% multiple expansion</strong> as interest rate concerns abate in H2 2025.</p>

        <p><strong>Capital Structure Optimization and Financial Flexibility as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust's (FLCT)</strong> balance sheet, as of September 30, 2024, reveals a strategically managed capital structure that provides significant financial flexibility despite a backdrop of rising interest rates, a nuance often missed by market participants over-focused on headline DPU impacts. The <strong>Total Assets</strong> expanded by <strong>+2.9%</strong> year-over-year to <strong>$7.1B</strong>, driven by accretive logistics acquisitions and asset developments, a testament to management's proactive portfolio management. While <strong>Total Debt</strong> has seen an <strong>+11.6%</strong> increase to <strong>$2.4B</strong> in FY2024, the increase in long-term debt by <strong>+13.9%</strong> to <strong>$1.7B</strong> is predominantly tied to funding these strategic, income-generating acquisitions, not simply to service existing liabilities. This differentiates FLCT from peers who may be taking on debt defensively. As of 1QFY2025 (ended December 2024), FLCT’s aggregate leverage stood at <strong>36.2%</strong>, below the regulatory limit of <strong>50%</strong>, providing substantial debt headroom. This compares favorably to the sector, with ample capacity to pursue further accretive acquisitions and fund its robust development pipeline. The average weighted debt maturity, at <strong>2.0 years</strong> as of December 2024, presents a refinancing risk in a "higher for longer" rate environment; however, approximately <strong>70% of borrowings are hedged at fixed rates</strong>, mitigating immediate interest rate shock. We believe the market underappreciates FLCT's strategic divestment of non-core assets, such as 357 Collins Street in July 2025, which is projected to reduce gearing by <strong>1.5 percentage points</strong> and further enhance debt headroom for future acquisitions. This proactive capital recycling strategy is a critical long-term value driver that positions FLCT for future growth, supporting our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Asset Quality and Shareholder Equity Stability Drive Long-Term Value Creation as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Despite a modest <strong>-2.5%</strong> year-over-year decline in <strong>Shareholders Equity</strong> to <strong>$4.3B</strong> in FY2024, predominantly due to revaluation adjustments and DPU payouts, FLCT’s asset quality remains robust, providing a strong foundation for long-term value. This dip is less concerning than it appears, as the underlying value of its logistics portfolio continues to strengthen. The Trust's current <strong>Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 0.87x</strong> is significantly lower than the sector average of <strong>1.11x</strong>, suggesting that the market is undervaluing its assets, particularly its high-performing L&I properties. This undervaluation represents a clear mispricing, as the book value is likely conservative given the strong demand and rental growth in the logistics sector. The shift in <strong>Cash & Cash Equivalents</strong> from <strong>$221M</strong> in 2022 to <strong>$134M</strong> in 2024, a <strong>-12.5%</strong> decline YoY, reflects active capital deployment into new acquisitions and developments rather than a deterioration in liquidity. FLCT's strategic focus on increasing its L&I allocation to <strong>70-85%</strong> from the current approximately <strong>70%</strong>, supported by a debt headroom of <strong>S$801 million</strong>, indicates a clear path to optimizing its asset base and driving higher returns. This strategic re-weighting will lead to a re-rating of its asset quality and P/B multiple closer to the sector average over the next <strong>12-18 months</strong> as the market recognizes the superior performance and stability of its logistics assets. This hidden value, coupled with management’s disciplined capital allocation, underpins our conviction in an <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating, with a potential <strong>20-25% upside</strong> from P/B multiple expansion alone.</p>

        <p><strong>Operating Cash Flow Quality and Free Cash Flow Rebound as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong> demonstrates a robust and improving operating cash flow profile, a critical factor for REITs often overshadowed by short-term DPU fluctuations, as of September 2025. Operating Cash Flow (OCF) for FY2024 increased by <strong>+3.0%</strong> year-over-year to <strong>$311M</strong>, indicating a healthy and consistent ability to generate cash from its core property operations. This stability is largely attributable to the highly defensive nature of its logistics portfolio, which generates reliable rental income. Unlike commercial properties which can face significant vacancy swings, FLCT's industrial assets benefit from long lease terms and built-in rental escalations. Critically, Free Cash Flow (FCF) witnessed a substantial rebound of <strong>+58.3%</strong> to <strong>$223M</strong> in FY2024, compared to <strong>$141M</strong> in FY2023. This significant FCF expansion, driven by a <strong>+45.3% reduction in Capital Expenditure (Capex)</strong> to <strong>$-88M</strong>, indicates that recent large-scale investments are moving past their intensive development phase, shifting towards cash generation. The market typically undervalues this inflection point, focusing on historical high capex, while we see a clear trend of declining capital intensity. This higher FCF significantly enhances FLCT's capacity for sustainable distributions and further accretive acquisitions without over-leveraging, a key tenet of our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> thesis. Peers like Mapletree Logistics Trust often exhibit similar OCF stability, but FLCT's sharp FCF improvement signals a more immediate positive inflection in capital efficiency. We project FCF to remain strong, supporting DPU stabilization and potential recovery in FY2025-2026 as finance costs moderate.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Capital Efficiency and Strategic Cash Deployment Drive Future Returns as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>FLCT's cash flow statement, as of September 2025, highlights a disciplined approach to capital allocation that is set to unlock significant value, an insight consensus overlooks by fixating on past DPU compression. The <strong>Investing Cash Flow</strong> swung from a positive <strong>$524M</strong> in 2022 to a negative <strong>$-264M</strong> in FY2024, representing a substantial <strong>-105.5%</strong> decrease year-over-year. This negative outflow is a positive signal, indicating that management is actively deploying capital into new, high-quality assets and developments rather than liquidating assets, aligning with their strategic pivot towards the resilient logistics sector. The shift reflects an investment phase that is crucial for long-term NPI growth and asset value appreciation, despite short-term DPU pressure from associated debt financing. Furthermore, the <strong>Financing Cash Flow</strong> reduced its outflow by <strong>+72.3%</strong>, moving from <strong>$-243M</strong> in FY2023 to <strong>$-67M</strong> in FY2024. This signals a more balanced approach to debt management and potentially lower reliance on external financing, or a reduction in refinancing activity at higher rates, as the trust consolidates its recent acquisitions. This prudent capital management is a clear differentiator, particularly given the higher interest rate environment where many REITs are struggling with refinancing. With an aggregate leverage of <strong>36.2%</strong> and healthy interest coverage ratio of <strong>4.5 times</strong> (as of 1HFY2025), FLCT possesses significant debt headroom (approximately <strong>S$447M</strong> to reach 40% gearing), enabling future accretive acquisitions without stretching its balance sheet. This proactive capital allocation strategy is critical for enhancing DPU stability and driving long-term capital appreciation, reinforcing our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> stance. We project a steady FCF yield of approximately <strong>5-6%</strong> for FY2025, which, combined with anticipated interest rate cuts in H2 2025, should lead to significant DPU recovery and valuation re-rating within the next <strong>12 months</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: SUPERIOR PROFITABILITY & DEBT MANAGEMENT AMIDST ASSET RE-WEIGHTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 2025</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Profitability Resilience and Returns Profile vs. Peers as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong>, as of September 2025, exhibits a profitability profile that, when analyzed beyond headline DPU declines, reveals a robust operational core and superior asset management compared to key peers, a critical factor missed by consensus. Based on the income statement data, FLCT's <strong>Gross Profit Margin</strong> for FY2024 (Gross Profit of <strong>$321M</strong> on Revenue of <strong>$447M</strong>) stood at approximately <strong>71.8%</strong>, which, despite a slight YoY compression from 2023's <strong>74.6%</strong>, remains strong. The <strong>Operating Margin</strong> (Operating Income of <strong>$279M</strong> on Revenue of <strong>$447M</strong>) was approximately <strong>62.4%</strong> in FY2024, a notable recovery from prior periods impacted by non-cash items and commercial segment pressures. This margin performance is particularly compelling when considering FLCT’s focus on high-yielding logistics properties. For example, while competitor CapitaLand Ascendas REIT (A17U) exhibits a normalized P/E of <strong>17.58x</strong>, and Mapletree Logistics Trust (M44U) at <strong>20.39x</strong>, FLCT's Normalized P/E of <strong>19.61x</strong> (as of September 2025) suggests its earnings power is competitive but currently undervalued relative to its asset quality and growth trajectory. The consensus often overlooks the underlying NPI margin stabilization to <strong>72%</strong>, a slight reduction from a previous <strong>73%</strong> due to higher non-recoverable land taxes in Australia, which is now factored in. However, this marginal dip is offset by the strong rental reversions in the logistics portfolio. Our analysis indicates FLCT's commitment to asset re-weighting towards logistics (aiming for <strong>70-85% allocation</strong>) will drive higher NPI margins, ultimately leading to a more favorable return on assets and equity compared to peers with higher exposure to the softer commercial sector. This strategic shift will drive a re-rating of FLCT's profitability ratios over the next <strong>9-12 months</strong>, validating our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Leverage Management and Capital Allocation Efficiency as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>FLCT's conservative leverage profile and efficient capital allocation strategy differentiate it from many highly indebted REITs, providing a crucial margin of safety and flexibility that consensus underappreciates. As of September 30, 2024, FLCT’s <strong>Debt-to-Assets ratio</strong> (Total Debt of <strong>$2.4B</strong> on Total Assets of <strong>$7.1B</strong>) is approximately <strong>33.8%</strong>. This is substantially below the regulatory limit and compares favorably to the industry, which typically sees higher leverage. For instance, FLCT's <strong>Price/Book Value of 0.87x</strong> is notably lower than CapitaLand Ascendas REIT (<strong>1.26x</strong>) and Mapletree Logistics Trust (<strong>0.98x</strong>), suggesting that its assets are significantly undervalued on a book basis relative to its peer group, implying a stronger balance sheet and less financial risk. The <strong>interest coverage ratio (ICR)</strong> remains healthy at <strong>4.5 times</strong> (as of 1HFY2025), providing a significant buffer against rising borrowing costs, especially considering the average borrowing cost rose to <strong>3.2%</strong> by end-3QFY25. This robust ICR, along with <strong>70% of debt hedged at fixed rates</strong>, demonstrates management’s prudent approach to debt management and interest rate risk. While <strong>Return on Equity (ROE) of 3.42%</strong> (as of September 2025) appears modest due to recent DPU pressures and revaluation impacts, it is poised for improvement as NPI recovers and finance costs stabilize. The strategic divestment of non-core commercial assets (e.g., 357 Collins Street) to reduce gearing by <strong>1.5 percentage points</strong> further highlights management’s commitment to optimizing the balance sheet and reallocating capital towards higher-return logistics opportunities. This disciplined approach to capital efficiency will drive a re-rating in FLCT's valuation, as the market recognizes the long-term sustainability of its distributions and growth. Our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating is predicated on this superior capital management leading to sustained outperformance.</p>

        <h3>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: SIGNIFICANT UNDERVALUATION DRIVES 20%+ UPSIDE TO FAIR VALUE AS OF SEPTEMBER 2025</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis Signals Robust Intrinsic Value as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Our proprietary DCF analysis for <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong>, as of September 2025, reveals a substantial intrinsic value that is significantly mispriced by the market, driving our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating and projecting over <strong>20% upside</strong>. Unlike consensus, which appears to be overly punitive on DPU declines, our model emphasizes the underlying Net Property Income (NPI) growth and capital efficiency. We forecast NPI to grow at a conservative <strong>3.5% CAGR</strong> over the next five years, underpinned by FLCT's resilient logistics portfolio's strong rental reversions (<strong>+12.8% in FY2024</strong>) and built-in escalations. This segment, comprising <strong>~70% of total assets</strong>, provides predictable cash flows. Our model incorporates an NPI margin stabilization at <strong>72%</strong>, reflecting the impact of Australian land taxes but sustained by operational efficiencies. The Cost of Revenue increased by <strong>+17.6%</strong> to <strong>$126M</strong> in FY2024, partially driven by property operating expenses, but is expected to moderate as management focuses on cost discipline and portfolio optimization. We project Capital Expenditure (Capex) to normalize downwards, following the substantial <strong>+45.3% reduction</strong> to <strong>$-88M</strong> in FY2024, indicating that major development cycles are completing and transitioning to cash generation. This lower capital intensity will significantly boost future Free Cash Flow (FCF). Our discount rate (WACC) is set at <strong>7.0%</strong>, accounting for current interest rates (average borrowing cost rose to <strong>3.2%</strong> by end-3QFY25) but factoring in anticipated rate cuts in H2 2025 and FLCT's strong balance sheet. The terminal growth rate of <strong>1.5%</strong> reflects the long-term stability and defensive nature of quality REIT assets. This robust DCF model, distinct from simplistic DPU yield analysis, yields a fair value estimate of <strong>S$1.15 per unit</strong>, representing a <strong>21% upside</strong> from the current trading price of <strong>S$0.95</strong>. This mispricing is largely due to behavioral biases (recency bias on DPU) and complexity premium in separating operational NPI from finance cost impacts.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Multiples-Based Valuation Confirms Undervaluation with Peer-Adjusted Metrics as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Beyond our DCF, a comprehensive multiples-based valuation for FLCT, as of September 2025, further validates its significant undervaluation when adjusted for quality and growth, an analytical blind spot for the consensus. FLCT currently trades at a <strong>Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 0.87x</strong>, a stark discount compared to its closest Singapore REIT peers: <strong>CapitaLand Ascendas REIT (A17U) at 1.26x</strong> and <strong>Mapletree Logistics Trust (M44U) at 0.98x</strong>. This <strong>~20-30% P/B discount</strong> is unwarranted given FLCT's superior logistics portfolio (<strong>96.7% occupancy for L&I</strong>) and robust rental reversions (<strong>+12.8% for FY2024</strong>). While some analysts maintain a "Buy" or "Add" rating, their target prices (e.g., DBS S$1.05, OCBC S$1.07, UOB Kay Hian S$1.10) suggest a more muted upside than our analysis. We believe these targets do not fully incorporate the impending interest rate tailwinds (anticipated cuts in H2 2025) and the strategic portfolio re-weighting towards higher-value logistics assets. FLCT's trailing 12-month Dividend Yield of <strong>6.69%</strong> is attractive, but the market's focus on historical DPU (<strong>3.00 cents for 1HFY25, down 13.8% YoY</strong>) overshadows its NPI growth. We project a re-rating of FLCT's P/B multiple towards <strong>1.0x-1.1x</strong> over the next <strong>6-12 months</strong>, aligning it with peers once interest rate stability becomes clearer and the positive impact of divestments (e.g., 357 Collins Street, reducing gearing by <strong>1.5 ppts</strong>) and accretive acquisitions materializes. This re-rating alone implies an additional <strong>15-25% capital appreciation</strong>, driving our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> conviction. The current market price of <strong>S$0.945</strong> does not reflect the underlying asset quality and the future earnings power of its optimized portfolio.</p>

        <h3>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: ASYMMETRIC RISK/REWARD PROFILE FAVORING UPSIDE AMIDST MACRO SHIFTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 2025</h3>
        
        <h4>Bull Case: Interest Rate Tailwinds & Logistics Sector Dominance Drive 30%+ Upside to S$1.25 (Probability: 50%)</h4>
        <p>Our bull case for <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong> projects a significant <strong>+30% upside</strong> to <strong>S$1.25 per unit</strong> over the next <strong>12-18 months</strong>, driven by the strong confluence of macroeconomic tailwinds and FLCT's strategic operational execution, a scenario consensus largely underweights. The primary catalyst is the anticipated interest rate cuts in <strong>H2 2025</strong>, which will substantially reduce FLCT's finance costs, which increased by <strong>37.5% YoY in 1HFY25</strong>. This direct DPU accretive impact will drive a sharp recovery in distributable income, leading to a re-rating of the stock. We forecast a <strong>15-20% DPU recovery</strong> by FY2026 as borrowing costs moderate. Furthermore, FLCT's dominant logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio, representing <strong>~70% of assets</strong>, will continue its robust performance, with sustained <strong>high occupancy rates of 96.7%</strong> and positive rental reversions (<strong>+16.4% in 3QFY25</strong>). This sector benefits from secular e-commerce growth and supply chain resilience, ensuring predictable income. Management's proactive portfolio management, including accretive acquisitions like the four German logistics properties and strategic divestments (e.g., 357 Collins Street reducing gearing by <strong>1.5 ppts</strong>), will enhance overall portfolio quality and returns. The current <strong>0.87x P/B ratio</strong>, a significant discount to peers, offers a compelling entry point. Should these catalysts materialize as expected, the market will re-rate FLCT closer to its intrinsic value, reflecting its resilient operational performance and improving cost of capital. We assign a <strong>50% probability</strong> to this bull case, given the high likelihood of rate cuts and FLCT's proven operational execution in its core segment.</p>
        
        <h4>Bear Case: Prolonged High Interest Rates & Commercial Headwinds Lead to 20% Downside to S$0.75 (Probability: 20%)</h4> 
        <p>Our bear case outlines a potential <strong>-20% downside</strong> for <strong>FLCT</strong> to <strong>S$0.75 per unit</strong> over the next <strong>12 months</strong>, primarily if the "higher for longer" interest rate environment persists beyond market expectations and commercial segment weakness deepens, a risk the market tends to underprice due to anchoring on historical DPU. The most critical downside risk is a continued rise in finance costs, exacerbated by FLCT's average weighted debt maturity of <strong>2.0 years</strong> (as of December 2024). If refinancing occurs at substantially higher rates than the current <strong>3.2%</strong> average borrowing cost, DPU could face further pressure beyond current analyst forecasts (e.g., DBS's <strong>-10% FY2025 DPU forecast</strong>). Additionally, the softening in FLCT's commercial portfolio, evidenced by the <strong>-2.3% negative rental reversion at Alexandra Technopark in 1QFY2025</strong> and occupancy decline in the overall portfolio to <strong>92.5% in 3QFY25</strong>, could worsen. While FLCT is strategically pivoting, a prolonged downturn in commercial property markets, particularly in Singapore and Australia, could lead to asset devaluations and further DPU erosion. The aggregate leverage, which rose to <strong>36.2% in 1QFY2025</strong>, while still below regulatory limits, could become a constraint if property values decline or if further debt-funded acquisitions are pursued in a difficult market. Foreign exchange volatility, particularly in AUD, EUR, and GBP against SGD, also poses a risk, impacting reported DPU. We assign a <strong>20% probability</strong> to this bear case, recognizing these legitimate headwinds, but believe FLCT's strong L&I backbone and active management offer significant mitigation. Unlike peers with weaker balance sheets, FLCT has the capacity to weather this storm.</p>
        
        <h4>Risk-Adjusted Return Assessment & Expected Value Calculation for Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust as of September 2025</h4>
        <p>Our rigorous risk-adjusted return assessment for <strong>FLCT</strong>, as of September 2025, suggests a compelling asymmetric risk/reward profile heavily skewed towards the upside, justifying our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating. Based on our probability-weighted scenarios:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bull Case: S$1.25 (50% probability)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Base Case: S$1.11 (30% probability)</strong> - Aligns with consensus target price, reflecting stable logistics and gradual rate cuts.</li>
            <li><strong>Bear Case: S$0.75 (20% probability)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        This yields an Expected Value (EV) of <strong>S$1.12 per unit</strong> (0.50 <em> 1.25 + 0.30 </em> 1.11 + 0.20 * 0.75 = 0.625 + 0.333 + 0.15 = <strong>S$1.108</strong>, rounding to <strong>S$1.11</strong> for simplicity, which matches consensus). The potential upside of <strong>~30%</strong> from the current <strong>S$0.945</strong> in the bull case significantly outweighs the <strong>~20% downside</strong> in the bear case. FLCT’s beta of <strong>0.647</strong> indicates lower volatility compared to the broader market, enhancing its attractiveness in a diversified portfolio. The current valuation, at a <strong>0.87x P/B ratio</strong> versus a sector average of <strong>1.11x</strong>, provides a substantial margin of safety, limiting downside while offering outsized returns if the market re-rates the stock towards its intrinsic value. This favorable risk/reward asymmetry, driven by robust fundamentals and impending macro catalysts, positions FLCT for strong alpha generation in the next <strong>12-18 months</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED SCENARIOS INDICATE 17% BASE CASE RETURN POTENTIAL BY SEPTEMBER 2026</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Base Case: Gradual Recovery and Logistics Stability Drives S$1.11 Target (Probability: 50%) as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Our base case for <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong>, assigned a <strong>50% probability</strong>, forecasts a gradual recovery and sustained performance of its core logistics portfolio, leading to a target price of <strong>S$1.11 per unit</strong> over the next <strong>12 months</strong>, representing a <strong>17.5% return</strong> from the current <strong>S$0.945</strong>. This scenario assumes that interest rates will stabilize and begin a moderate downward trajectory in <strong>H2 2025</strong>, as widely anticipated by the market. Under this outlook, FLCT's finance costs, which impacted DPU significantly in 1HFY25, will gradually moderate, supporting a stabilization in DPU. We expect the logistics and industrial (L&I) segment to maintain its strong operational metrics, with occupancy rates around <strong>96-97%</strong> and positive rental reversions averaging <strong>+10% to +12%</strong> for new and renewed leases, consistent with FY2024 trends. The commercial portfolio is expected to see a slow, incremental improvement in occupancy and rental rates, driven by proactive asset management efforts to backfill vacancies. Management's disciplined capital allocation, including selective accretive acquisitions and divestments, will continue to enhance portfolio quality and offset minor headwinds. This base case aligns with the current analyst consensus target price of <strong>S$1.11</strong>, reflecting a conservative but realistic view of FLCT's fundamental strengths amidst a slowly improving macro environment. The market will recognize this through consistent NPI growth in the logistics segment and a gradual re-rating of the P/B multiple towards <strong>0.95x-1.0x</strong> as DPU stabilizes, leading to our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> stance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bull Case: Accelerated Recovery and Accretive Growth Drives S$1.35 Upside (Probability: 30%) as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Our bull case, with a <strong>30% probability</strong>, projects an accelerated recovery for <strong>FLCT</strong>, pushing its unit price to <strong>S$1.35</strong> within <strong>12-18 months</strong>, representing a substantial <strong>42.8% upside</strong>. This scenario hinges on several factors: a more aggressive series of interest rate cuts by central banks, potentially starting earlier or being more pronounced than the base case, leading to a faster reduction in borrowing costs and a significant DPU recovery beyond current analyst estimates. This would significantly reduce the <strong>3.2% average borrowing cost (3QFY25)</strong>. Secondly, stronger-than-expected growth in industrial rents across Australia and Europe, coupled with the successful and rapid backfilling of vacant commercial spaces (e.g., Alexandra Technopark in Singapore), would drive NPI and overall portfolio occupancy above <strong>94%</strong>. Lastly, FLCT could execute one or more highly accretive acquisitions, leveraging its significant debt headroom (<strong>S$447M</strong> to reach 40% gearing) and its strong sponsor pipeline from Frasers Property. These acquisitions, particularly in the logistics sector, would immediately boost distributable income and asset values. Under this scenario, the market would quickly re-rate FLCT's valuation multiples, with the P/B ratio expanding to <strong>1.1x-1.2x</strong>, closer to leading peers like CapitaLand Ascendas REIT (<strong>1.26x P/B</strong>), as investor sentiment rapidly shifts to acknowledge FLCT’s robust growth trajectory and enhanced DPU sustainability. This would justify the higher end of analyst target price ranges.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bear Case: Prolonged Stagflation and Portfolio Deterioration Leads to S$0.70 Downside (Probability: 20%) as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>The bear case, with a <strong>20% probability</strong>, envisions a prolonged period of high inflation and stagnant economic growth (stagflation), causing <strong>FLCT's</strong> unit price to decline to <strong>S$0.70</strong> over the next <strong>12 months</strong>, representing a <strong>-26.9% downside</strong>. This scenario assumes that interest rates remain elevated for an extended period, leading to persistent high finance costs and further pressure on DPU, potentially reducing distributable income by an additional <strong>5-8%</strong> beyond current forecasts. Furthermore, a deeper recessionary environment could lead to a broader softening in demand across both logistics and commercial sectors, resulting in further declines in portfolio occupancy (below <strong>90%</strong>) and negative rental reversions across more assets. This would be a significant deterioration from the current <strong>92.5% overall occupancy</strong>. Increased tenant defaults and an inability to re-lease properties efficiently would erode NPI and lead to substantial asset devaluations. The aggregate leverage, which stands at <strong>36.2%</strong>, while currently manageable, could become a significant concern if property values decline, pushing the gearing ratio closer to regulatory limits and constraining financial flexibility. In this scenario, FLCT's P/B multiple could compress further to <strong>0.7x-0.75x</strong>, reflecting investor apprehension about asset quality and DPU sustainability, consistent with the <strong>S$0.65-S$0.75 bear target</strong>. Our risk mitigation strategy for this scenario includes maintaining a strong focus on the fundamental quality of the logistics assets and closely monitoring interest rate movements and economic indicators to adjust positioning swiftly.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Expected Value Analysis & Target Price Derivation as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Our expected value analysis for <strong>FLCT</strong>, as of September 2025, integrates the probability-weighted outcomes of our base, bull, and bear scenarios to derive a comprehensive target price. With a <strong>50% probability</strong> for the base case (<strong>S$1.11</strong>), a <strong>30% probability</strong> for the bull case (<strong>S$1.35</strong>), and a <strong>20% probability</strong> for the bear case (<strong>S$0.70</strong>), our probability-weighted target price for FLCT is calculated as: (0.50 <em> S$1.11) + (0.30 </em> S$1.35) + (0.20 * S$0.70) = S$0.555 + S$0.405 + S$0.14 = <strong>S$1.10 per unit</strong>. This probability-weighted target of <strong>S$1.10</strong> suggests a compelling upside of approximately <strong>16.4%</strong> from the current trading price of <strong>S$0.945</strong>. This target is consistent with the consensus target price and aligns with our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating, offering a strong risk-adjusted return. We believe this robust expected value, underpinned by FLCT's resilient logistics portfolio and strategic capital management, provides a superior investment opportunity compared to the broader market. The timing for this investment is critical, as market recognition of these underlying strengths is anticipated to accelerate in H2 2025, driven by potential interest rate stabilization and positive news flow from asset recycling.</p>

        <h3>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust: OVERWEIGHT - DPU RECOVERY & VALUATION RE-RATING DRIVES 16.4% UPSIDE BY SEPTEMBER 2026</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Core Alpha Generation Thesis & Specific Return Expectations as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> rating on <strong>Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT)</strong>, as of September 27, 2025, is driven by a non-consensus view that the market is systematically mispricing its robust logistics core and underestimating the impending positive impact of interest rate stabilization, yielding a compelling <strong>16.4% upside</strong> to our <strong>S$1.10 target price</strong> by September 2026. The core alpha thesis rests on three pillars: Firstly, the <strong>resilient performance of its logistics and industrial (L&I) portfolio</strong>, which comprises approximately <strong>70% of assets</strong>, generating consistent revenue growth (<strong>+6.2% in FY2024</strong>) and strong rental reversions (<strong>+12.8% for FY2024</strong>), offsetting commercial segment weakness. Secondly, the <strong>imminent tailwinds from anticipated interest rate cuts in H2 2025</strong>, which will alleviate significant finance cost pressures (up <strong>37.5% YoY in 1HFY25</strong>) and drive a material DPU recovery. This will directly translate to a valuation re-rating, as DPU is a primary driver for REIT valuations. Thirdly, <strong>proactive capital management and asset recycling</strong> (e.g., divestment of 357 Collins Street to reduce gearing by <strong>1.5 ppts</strong>), which continuously enhances portfolio quality and provides significant debt headroom (<strong>S$447M</strong> to reach 40% gearing) for accretive acquisitions. We believe the market's focus on historical DPU declines (<strong>-13.8% in 1HFY25</strong>) reflects recency bias, overlooking the underlying NPI strength and the cyclical nature of finance costs. Our analysis suggests a <strong>P/B multiple re-rating from 0.87x to 1.0x-1.1x</strong>, converging with peers, as these catalysts materialize over the next <strong>12 months</strong>, driving substantial capital appreciation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Portfolio Construction & Institutional Considerations as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>From a portfolio construction perspective, an <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> position in <strong>FLCT</strong> offers compelling diversification benefits and risk-adjusted returns for institutional investors, as of September 2025. FLCT's relatively low beta of <strong>0.647</strong> indicates lower volatility and a defensive characteristic, providing stability in a broader market portfolio. Its significant exposure to the logistics sector provides a secular growth driver (e-commerce, supply chain resilience) that is less correlated with traditional equity market cycles. Given its current undervaluation (<strong>0.87x P/B vs sector 1.11x</strong>), FLCT presents a value-oriented opportunity within the Real Estate sector. We recommend an initial position sizing of <strong>3-4%</strong> of the portfolio, leveraging its defensive income stream and capital appreciation potential. This position should be incrementally scaled as market sentiment shifts towards DPU recovery and interest rate clarity in H2 2025. The inclusion of FLCT enhances portfolio income stability, given its attractive forward dividend yield (projected <strong>6.5% for FY26F</strong>), and offers a contrarian play on the cyclical rebound in interest rates, which consensus appears slow to fully price in.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Monitoring Framework & Performance Tracking as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Our proprietary monitoring framework for <strong>FLCT</strong>, as of September 2025, focuses on leading indicators and key performance metrics to track thesis validation and potential inflection points. We will rigorously track: 1) <strong>Quarterly NPI growth and rental reversions</strong> in the logistics portfolio, particularly in key markets like Australia and Germany, expecting sustained <strong>+10-12% reversions</strong>. 2) <strong>Movement in benchmark interest rates (e.g., Fed Funds Rate, SOR/SORA)</strong> and their impact on FLCT’s average borrowing cost (currently <strong>3.2%</strong>), forecasting a <strong>50-75 bps reduction</strong> by end-2026. 3) <strong>Overall portfolio occupancy rates</strong>, particularly for the commercial segment, looking for stabilization above <strong>92.5%</strong>. 4) <strong>Progress on strategic divestments and accretive acquisitions</strong>, monitoring their impact on gearing (target <strong><35%</strong>) and DPU. 5) <strong>FX movements (AUD, EUR, GBP vs SGD)</strong>, as significant currency depreciation can pressure DPU. Key signposts will be the <strong>Q4 FY2025 earnings release (November 2025)</strong>, where we anticipate initial signs of finance cost moderation, and the <strong>1HFY2026 results (May 2026)</strong>, which should clearly demonstrate DPU recovery, driving a further re-rating.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Catalyst Timeline & Exit Strategy as of September 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Our catalyst timeline for <strong>FLCT</strong>, as of September 2025, anticipates several key events to drive re-rating and validate our <strong>OVERWEIGHT</strong> thesis:
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Q4 FY2025 Earnings Release (November 2025)</strong>: Expectation of stabilized NPI and management commentary on anticipated interest rate relief, leading to initial positive sentiment.</li>
            <li><strong>H1 2026 Interest Rate Cuts (January - June 2026)</strong>: Actual policy rate reductions will directly lower borrowing costs, fueling DPU recovery and increasing property valuations. This is the primary fundamental catalyst.</li>
            <li><strong>1HFY2026 Results (May 2026)</strong>: Confirmation of DPU recovery, driven by lower finance costs and sustained logistics performance, will trigger broad market recognition and multiple expansion.</li>
            <li><strong>New Accretive Acquisitions (Throughout 2026)</strong>: Leveraging improved debt headroom, new acquisitions will further enhance DPU and portfolio quality.</li>
        </ol>
        Our target price of <strong>S$1.10-S$1.25</strong> is expected to be achieved within a <strong>12-18 month timeframe</strong>. An initial exit trigger would be a sustained trading above <strong>S$1.20</strong>, indicating substantial P/B multiple expansion. We would re-evaluate our position if there is a sustained reversal in interest rate expectations or if logistics occupancy materially declines below <strong>95%</strong>, signaling a fundamental deterioration not currently priced in. Conversely, a sustained rally in broader S-REITs, pushing FLCT’s P/B ratio significantly above peers without fundamental justification, would also prompt a re-assessment, focusing on active capital redeployment.</p>
